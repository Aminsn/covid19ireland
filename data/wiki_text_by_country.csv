An ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for the virus.[3] One week later an Italian man repatriated back to Italy from the city of Wuhan, China, was hospitalised and confirmed as the third case in Italy.[4] A cluster of cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February,[5] and 60 additional cases and first deaths on 22 February.[6] By the beginning of March, the virus had spread to all regions of Italy.[7]
On 31 January, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency. In February, eleven municipalities in northern Italy were identified as the centres of the two main Italian clusters and placed under quarantine. The majority of positive cases in other regions traced back to these two clusters.[8] On 8 March 2020, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte expanded the quarantine to all of Lombardy and 14 other northern provinces, and on the following day to all of Italy, placing more than 60 million people in quarantine.[9][10][11] On 11 March 2020, Conte prohibited nearly all commercial activity except for supermarkets and pharmacies.[12][13] On 21 March, the Italian government closed all non-essential businesses and industries, and further restricted movement of people.[14]
On 6 March 2020, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations regarding triage protocols that might be employed.[15][16][17] By 24 March, Italy had conducted 296,964 tests for the virus.[18]
As of 24 March 2020, Italy is the world's centre of active coronavirus cases with 54,030 active cases – more than the number of active cases of any other country or territory.[19] The total of confirmed cases is 69,176, with 6,820 deaths, and 8,326 recoveries.[2] On 19 March, Italy became the country with the highest number of confirmed deaths in the world.[20]
On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Wuhan, Hubei, China, informed the WHO about a cluster of acute pneumonia cases with unknown origin in its province. On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) reported the identification of a novel coronavirus (later identified as the SARS-CoV-2) as the cause.[21] In late January 2020, following the developments of COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China, on February 3, Italy set up enhanced screening measures, including thermal cameras and medical staff at airports.[22]
Notes:
On 31 January, the first two cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Rome. A Chinese couple, originally from Wuhan, who had arrived in Italy on January 23 via Milan Malpensa Airport, travelled from the airport to Verona, then to Parma, arriving in Rome on 28 January. The next afternoon, they developed a cough, and by evening the man had a fever; the couple were taken to Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases where they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were hospitalised.[23][3] On 31 January, the Italian government suspended all flights to and from China and declared a state of emergency with the duration of six months. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said Italy was the first EU country to take this kind of precautionary measure.[24] The government also introduced thermal scanners and temperature checks on international passengers arriving at Italian airports.[22]
On 6 February, an Italian repatriated from Wuhan tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in Italy to three.[25]
On 22 February, the repatriated Italian recovered and was discharged from the hospital.[26] On 22 and 26 February, the two previously infected Chinese tourists tested negative for COVID-19 at Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute in Rome.[27]
The Lombardy outbreak came to light when a 38-year-old Italian tested positive in Codogno, a comune in the province of Lodi. On 14 February, he felt unwell and went to a doctor in Castiglione d'Adda. He was prescribed treatments for influenza.[28] On 16 February, as the man's condition worsened, he went to Codogno Hospital, reporting respiratory problems.[28] Initially there was no suspicion of COVID-19, so no additional precautionary measures were taken, and the virus was able to infect other patients and health workers.[29] On 19 February, the wife of the patient revealed he had met an Italian friend who had returned from China on 21 January, who subsequently tested negative.[28] Later, the patient, his pregnant wife and a friend tested positive.[28] On 20 February, three more cases were confirmed after the patients reported symptoms of pneumonia.[30] Thereafter, extensive screenings and checks were performed on everyone that had possibly been in contact with or near the infected subjects.[31] It has been subsequently reported that the origin of these cases has a possible connection to the first European local transmission that occurred in Munich, Germany, on 19 January 2020, consistent with phylogenetic analysis of viral genome.[32][33][34] The 38-year-old man was asymptomatic for weeks, reportedly led an active social life and potentially interacted with dozens of people before spreading the virus at Codogno Hospital.[28][29] Afterward, he was transferred to Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia,[35] and his wife to Sacco Hospital in Milan.[36][37]
On 21 February, 16 more cases were confirmed – 14 in Lombardy, including the doctor who prescribed treatments to the 38-year-old Codogno man,[28] and two in Veneto. On 22 February, a 77-year-old woman from Casalpusterlengo, who suffered from pneumonia and visited the same emergency room as the 38-year-old from Codogno, died in Lombardy.[38] Including the 78-year-old man who died in Veneto, the number of cases in Italy rose to 79.[6][39] Of the 76 newly discovered cases, 54 were found in Lombardy, including one patient in San Raffaele Hospital in Milan[40] and eight patients in Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia,[41] 17 in Veneto, two in Emilia-Romagna, two in Lazio and one in Piedmont.[42]
On 23 February, a 68-year-old woman with cancer from Trescore Cremasco died in Crema. The number of cases in Italy rose to 152, including fourteen patients being treated at Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia.[43][44] On 24 February, an 84-year-old man with pre-existing medical conditions from Villa di Serio died in Bergamo while hospitalised in the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital.[45] An 88-year-old man from Caselle Landi, who resided in Codogno, died on the same day.[46][47] An 80-year-old man from Castiglione d’Adda died at the Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan. He was previously hospitalised in Lodi because of a heart attack, and then transferred to Milan when confirmed as positive.[47][48][49] A 62-year-old man with pre-existing medical conditions from Castiglione d'Adda died in Sant'Anna Hospital in Como.[50] Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana announced that the number of cases in Lombardy had risen to 172, with a total of 229 confirmed in Italy.[51][52][53] On 25 February, an 84-year-old man from Nembro, a 91-year-old man from San Fiorano and an 83-year-old woman from Codogno died from complications caused by the infections.[54][55][56]
The number of cases in Emilia-Romagna rose to 23, spreading through the provinces of Piacenza, Parma, Modena and Rimini. These were all linked to the Lombardy cluster.[57][58][59][60][61] A new case linked to the outbreak in Lombardy appeared in Palermo, Sicily, when a 60-year-old woman from Bergamo tested positive and was admitted to Cervello Hospital.[62][63] A 49-year-old man who previously visited Codogno tested positive in Pescia, Tuscany.[64] Officials in Liguria confirmed that a 72-year-old female tourist from Castiglione d'Adda tested positive in Alassio while she was staying in a hotel. The woman was treated at a hospital in Genoa.[65] Later in the day, a second case in Liguria was confirmed, a 54-year-old man who had visited Codogno for work and tested positive in La Spezia.[66][67][68] On 26 February, a 69-year-old man from Lodi with pre-existing medical conditions died in Emilia-Romagna.[69] The mayor of Borgonovo Val Tidone, Pietro Mazzocchi, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent a voluntary isolation at home.[70]
Additional cases involving six minors were identified in Lombardy. A 4-year-old girl from Castiglione d'Adda was admitted to Policlinico San Matteo in Pavia, and a 15-year-old was hospitalised in Seriate Hospital in Bergamo. Two 10-year-olds from Cremona and Lodi tested positive and were discharged. A 17-year-old from Valtellina who attended a school in Codogno, and a school friend from Sondrio, also tested positive.[27][69][71] Officials in Apulia confirmed that a 33-year-old man from Taranto, who returned from Codogno on 24 February, tested positive and was admitted to San Giuseppe Moscati Hospital.[72] A close advisor to Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Although Fontana tested negative, he decided to put himself in preventive isolation as well.[73] Officials in Campania confirmed two new cases. A 24-year-old woman from Caserta, who had visited Milan, tested positive. A 25-year-old Ukrainian woman from Cremona, who previously visited Lombardy, tested positive at a hospital in Vallo della Lucania. Both were transferred to Hospital Domenico Cotugno in Naples, where they underwent isolation.[74]
On 26 February, a woman that had returned from Milan in the days before the emergency in Lombardy started tested positive for the virus in Catania, Sicily.[75] On 27 February, two 88-year-olds and an 80-year-old died in Lombardy.[76] Officials in Abruzzo confirmed that a 50-year-old man from Brianza, Lombardy tested positive and was admitted to the intensive-care unit at Giuseppe Mazzini Hospital at Teramo. He and his family were staying in his holiday home at Roseto degli Abruzzi.[66][77] On 28 February, four people died, including an 85-year-old Lombardy resident in one of the quarantine zones at a hospital in Piacenza, a 77-year-old and two others over the age of 80.[66] As of 1 March 2020[update], there were 984 confirmed cases and 73 recoveries in Lombardy.[66][78] On 4 March, Emilia-Romagna's regional minister of health, Raffaele Donini, and minister for territories, Barbara Lori, were declared positive for COVID-19.[79] Governor Stefano Bonaccini and the other members of the regional government tested negative.[80]

A secondary cluster of infections occurred in the region of Veneto, initially thought to be the result of a farmer being infected when visiting the primary source in Codogno.[29] The farmer was tested, and the following day, the test was confirmed negative.[83]
On 21 February 2020, two people tested positive in Veneto. The next day, one of them, a 78-year-old man, died at the Schiavonia Hospital in Monselice, making him the first fatality in Italy. The man lived in the municipality of Vò, which was put under quarantine.[84]
On 25 February, a 76-year-old woman with pre-existing medical conditions died in Treviso.[85]
On 26 February, an additional case involving a minor was identified. An 8-year-old girl who lived in Codevigo tested positive.[27][71][86]
On 28 February, Veneto governor Luca Zaia mentioned that after the first two cases, he ordered all 3,300 Vò residents to be tested. Of 6,800 swabs, 1.7% were confirmed positive. This epidemiological study would be used for outbreak investigation by the University of Padua.[87]
As of 28 February, there were 151 confirmed cases in Veneto, with 70 cases in the municipality of Vò, including the two fatalities.[66][87]
By 14 March, no new cases were detected in the municipality of Vò.[88]
A number of cases have emerged in multiple regions that might be isolated and not associated with the Northern Italy clusters.

The Ministry of Health announced new guidelines for reporting cases. It would no longer report asymptomatic cases (positive swabs taken from patients who were not showing symptoms), which had counted as 40 to 50% of all reported cases at the time. These people would undergo isolation at home and would be followed up with new tests until they were negative.[248][249] Universities in Lombardy extended their closure until 7 March.[66]
On 1 March, the Council of Ministers approved a decree to organise the containment of the outbreak. In the decree, the Italian national territory was divided into three areas:[250]

All organised events were also suspended, as well as events in public or private places, including those of a cultural, recreational, sporting and religious nature, even if held in closed places.[260] This measure was described as the largest lockdown in the history of Europe,[261][262] as well as the most aggressive response taken in any region beyond China, and paralysed the wealthiest parts of the country as Italy attempted to constrain the rapid spread of the disease.[263][264]
Riots broke out in many penitentiaries throughout Italy after restrictions on conjugal visits were imposed by the government in the 8 March decree.[265] Nine prisoners died in Modena and three in Rieti,[266][267] while 76 detainees escaped from Foggia's penitentiary.[268][269][270] Two prison agents were assaulted and kidnapped in Pavia.[271] On 9 March in Bologna, detainees took control of the Dozza penitentiary, forcing personnel to exit the building.[272] On 11 March, two prisoners were found dead in Bologna's penitentiary.[273]

Conte later proceeded to officially sign the new executive decree.[275][276]
On 11 March, the government allocated 25 billion euros for the emergency.[277] In the evening, Conte announced a tightening of the lockdown, with all commercial and retail businesses except those providing essential services, like grocery shops and pharmacies, closed down.[13][12][278] He also appointed Domenico Arcuri as Delegated Commissioner for the Emergency. Arcuri will cooperate with Commissioner Angelo Borrelli with the aim of strengthening the distribution of intensive care equipment.[279]
On 19 March the Army was deployed to the city of Bergamo, the worst hit Italian city by the coronavirus, as the local authorities can no longer process the number of dead residents. The city's mayor Giorgio Gori said the true number of dead could be much higher than reported.[280] Army trucks transported bodies to crematoriums in several other cities, as cemeteries in the city were full.[281] On the following day, the Army was called in to assist the police forces in enforcing the lockdown.[282]
On 20 March, the Ministry of Health ordered tighter regulations on free movement. The new measures banned open-air sports and running, except individually and in close proximity of one's residence.  Parks, playgrounds and public green were closed down. Furthermore, movement across the country was further restricted, by banning ""any movement towards a residence different from the main one"", including holiday homes, during weekends and holidays.[283]
On 21 March, Conte announced further restrictions within the nationwide lockdown, by halting all non-essential production, industries and businesses in Italy, following the rise in the number of new cases and deaths in the previous days.[284] This measure had also been strongly asked for by multiple institutions, including trade unions, mayors, and regional presidents, as well as medical professionals, but was initially opposed by the industrialists.[285][286][287][288][289][290]
On 24 March, in a live-streamed press conference, Conte announced a new decree approved by the Council of Ministers. The decree imposed higher fines for the violation of the restrictive measures, and a regulation of the relationship between government and Parliament during the emergency. It included also the possibility of reducing or suspending public and private transport, and gave the regional governments power to impose additional restrictive regulations in their Regions for a maximum of seven days before being confirmed by national decree.[291][292]
On 15 March, President of Campania Vincenzo De Luca imposed a strict quarantine on Ariano Irpino, in the province of Avellino, and four other municipalities in the province of Salerno, Atena Lucana, Caggiano, Polla, and Sala Consilina.[293]

On 22 February, the government established a lockdown for eleven municipalities in Lombardy and Veneto.[299]
On 7 March, the government prepared to extend until 3 April the restricted zone to all of Lombardy, plus fourteen other provinces in Veneto (3), Emilia-Romagna (5), Marche (1) and Piedmont (5).[301] The lockdown affects over 16 million people, roughly a quarter of Italy's total population, and prevents people from entering or leaving the zone, except ""for proven occupational needs or situations of need or for health reasons"",[302] under threat of fines.[303] The enclave nation of San Marino, which is nestled between two of the provinces, has been effectively locked down as well.[304]

The Union Health Ministry's war room and policy making team in New Delhi consists of the ministry's Emergency Medical Response Unit, the Central Surveillance Unit (IDSP), the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and experts from three government hospitals.[137] They are part of policy decisions to decide how coronavirus should be tackled in the country.[137] A cluster-containment strategy is mainly being adopted, similar to how India contained previous epidemics, as well as ""breaking the chain of transmission"".[137][138][139] 15 labs across India led by the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, are testing for the virus, with more labs being trained.[140] On 14 March 65 labs were named capable for testing for the virus (though as of 17 March not all are fully functional.[141][142][143]
On 14 March, scientists at the National Institute of Virology isolated a strain of the novel coronavirus. By doing so, India became the fifth country to successfully obtain a pure sample of the virus after China, Japan, Thailand and the US.[144] The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said that isolation of the virus will help towards expediting the development of drugs, vaccines and rapid diagnostic kits in the country.[145] NIV has shared two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences with GISAID.[146]
Initially, the labs tested samples only from those with a travel history to 12 countries designated as high-risk, or those who have come in contact with anyone testing positive for the coronavirus, or showing symptoms as per the government guidelines.[147][148] On 20 March,  the government decided to also include all pneumonia cases, regardless of travel or contact history after the country saw a sharp increase in the number of cases.[149] The first and second confirmatory tests for the virus has been made free by the government.[150] As of 14 March, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) has tested around 5,900 samples from individuals across the country. The number of tests per million in the country was 5 as of 14 March. In comparison, it is 26 in US, 76 in Japan, 1,005 in Italy and 4,099 in South Korea.[142] There are concerns that testing for the virus in India is being inadequately conducted and the need for ramping up the scale of testing is a necessity to understand the real scope of the number of people affected.[151]

On 19 March, Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy stated that India could be facing a ""tsunami of cases within a few weeks"" as testing increases and the reason for the low number of confirmed cases currently is due to under-testing. He also said that according to mathematical models applied in the US or UK at least 20%-60% of the population will be affected. Applying the same models in India means that at the lower end of the estimate there could be 300 million cases of which 4-8 million could be severe.[161]
On 24 March, Pune-based molecular diagnostic company Mylab Discovery Solutions became the first Indian company to have received validation for its RT-PCR tests from National Institute of Virology. The test's turn out time is 2.5 hours and the company is looking to price it at around ₹1,200 (US$17).

"
the United States ,"

An ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to the United States in January 2020. Cases have been confirmed in all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and all inhabited U.S. territories except American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.[5] As of March 25, the U.S. has the most active cases in the world.[6]
The first known case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was confirmed on January 20, 2020, in a 35-year-old man who had returned from Wuhan, China, five days earlier.[1] The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on January 29.[7] Two days later, the Trump administration declared a public health emergency and announced restrictions on travelers arriving from China.[8] On February 26, the first case in the U.S. in a person with ""no known exposure to the virus through travel or close contact with a known infected individual"" was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in northern California.[9]
From January to mid-March, the United States got off to a slow start in COVID-19 testing.[10][11] In that period, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) procedures forbade labs who followed internationally recognized test protocols from releasing results to patients. The FDA only approved non-government test kits from late February, and had restrictive test eligibility guidelines until early March. The CDC developed and distributed test kits of its own, many of which were found to have a manufacturing flaw in a non-essential component, which however made the kit illegal to use until the protocol was changed.[12][10][11] This was followed by the government announcing a series of measures intended to speed up testing. As of March 20, 100,000 tests had been conducted.[13] Private companies have begun to ship hundreds of thousands of tests. Drive-through testing stations are starting all over the country.[13] The CDC warned that widespread transmission may force large numbers of people to seek hospitalization and other healthcare, which may overload healthcare systems.[14] Since March 19, 2020, the Department of State has advised U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel.[15] The U.S. government has advised against any gathering of more than 10 people.[16]
After mid-March 2020, the federal government made a significant change of course to use the US military to initiate and lead an effort to rapidly grow COVID-19 intensive care facilities nationwide.  The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), under existing statutory authority that comes from congressional authorizations and powers of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), will be rapidly leasing a large number of buildings across the US in hotels and in larger open buildings to immediately grow the number of rooms and beds with ICU capability for patients of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, according to a briefing on March 20. USACE will handle leasing and engineering, with contracts for rapid facility modification and setup issued to local contractors.  The plan envisions that the operation of the facilities and the provision of medical staff would be entirely handled by the various U.S. states rather than the Federal government.[17]
Responses to the outbreak have included prohibitions and cancellation of large-scale gatherings, including the closure of schools and other educational institutions, the cancellation of trade shows, conventions, and music festivals, and the cancellation and suspension of sporting events and leagues.[18]
As of March 8, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has advised against non-essential travel to China, Iran, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the 26 European countries that comprise the Schengen Area. The United States is also denying entry to foreign nationals who have traveled through China, Iran, or the aforementioned European regions within the past 14 days. Americans returning home after traveling in these regions have been required to undergo a health screening and submit to a 14-day quarantine.[19][20] Quarantines are governed by section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S. Code § 264).[21][22]
On March 11 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.[18]
As of March 14, all 50 states were able to perform tests, with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs in a state, but the number of available test kits remained very limited,[23] which means that the true number of people currently infected with the virus is impossible to estimate with any reasonable accuracy.  The CDC has suggested that doctors use their own judgment along with certain guidelines before authorizing a test. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded 1,000, which doubled every two days to reach more than 17,000 cases by March 20.[24][25]
Of the 154 deaths in the country prior to March 20, 94 occurred in the state of Washington, with 35 of those at one nursing home.[26]
In a March 13, 2020 report ""not for public distribution"", the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) used the working assumptions for their response plan, that the COVID-19 ""pandemic will last 18 months or longer and could include multiple waves of illness"", and that resultant ""supply chain and transportation impacts"" would ""likely result in significant shortages"".[27]
On January 29, 2020, President Trump established the White House Coronavirus Task Force to coordinate and oversee efforts to ""monitor, prevent, contain, and mitigate the spread"" of COVID-19 in the United States.[28] Secretary of HHS Alex Azar was appointed as the leader of the task force.[29][7] On February 26, Trump appointed Vice President Mike Pence to take charge of the nation's response to the virus.[30] FEMA was put in charge of procuring medical supplies on March 17.[31][32]
The early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.[33]
National medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the coronavirus pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctor’s offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.[34]
The risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as Ebola, because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. While the new coronavirus is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially due to its easy ability to transmit between people and to remain asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.[33]
In general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and travel restrictions.[33]
February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.[35]
Chinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019 in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020. An American citizen, after traveling from Wuhan, China to his home in Washington state, became the first U.S. case of the new virus on January 20.[36] A few days later, Wuhan was placed under quarantine, soon to be followed by a quarantine of the entire Hubei province. On January 30, the WHO declared the new virus to be a global health emergency.[36]
President Trump imposed travel restrictions a day later preventing foreign nationals from entering the U.S. if they had been in China within the previous two weeks. The immediate family members of U.S. citizens and permanent residents were exempt from this restriction. In addition, Trump imposed a quarantine for up to 14 days on American citizens returning from Hubei province.[37] Although the WHO had recommended against travel restrictions at the time,[38]  HHS Secretary Alex Azar said the decision stemmed from the recommendations of HHS health officials.[39]  Trump expanded those travel restrictions to Iran on February 29.[39]
Over the following few weeks, the Trump administration imposed a number of other travel restrictions:
As part of the early efforts to contain and mitigate the pandemic within the United States, Surgeon General Jerome Adams announced in early March that that local leaders would soon have to consider whether to cancel large gatherings, consider telework policies, and close schools.[54] Over the next few weeks, a number of states had already imposed lockdown measures of different scope and severity, which placed limits on where people can travel, work and shop away from their homes.[55]
By March 21, Governors in New York, California and other large states, had ordered most businesses to close and for people to stay inside, with limited exceptions. The order in New York, for instance, exempts financial institutions, some retailers, pharmacies, hospitals, manufacturing plants and transportation companies, among others. It placed a ban non-essential gatherings of any size and for any reason.[55]
In late March, the federal government planned to send California eight large medical stations which can house 2,000 hospital beds. Four more stations with 1,000 beds were planned for New York, and Washington state would be getting three large federal medical stations and four small stations with 1,000 beds.[56] In addition, over 1,000 rooms in Chicago hotels were to be made available to house patients that may be infected and should not be returning home. That would reduce unnecessary strain on local hospitals and would free up their beds for seriously ill patients. Those in the hotel would be serviced by regular hotel workers after they are properly trained, and will not directly interact with guests.[57] Another containment and care facility planned would be two Navy hospital ships.[58]
The purposes of testing are to tell whether a person has a coronavirus infection, and to let health professionals know both how bad the epidemic is and where it is worst.[59]
While the World Health Organization opted to use the German approach to testing for COVID-19, the United States developed its own testing approach. The German testing method was made public on January 13, and the American testing method was made public on January 28. The World Health Organization did not offer any test kits to the U.S. because the U.S. normally had the supplies to produce their own tests.[60] In February, the U.S. CDC produced 160,000 coronavirus tests, but soon it was discovered that many were defective and gave inaccurate readings.[10][61] Although academic laboratories and hospitals had developed their own tests, they were not allowed to use them until February 29, when the FDA issued approvals for them and private companies.[10] Approvals were required by federal law due to the outbreak being declared as a public health emergency.[13]
Meanwhile, from the start of the outbreak to early March 2020, the CDC gave restrictive guidelines on who should be eligible for COVID-19 testing. The initial criteria were (a) people who had recently traveled to certain countries affected by the outbreak, or (b) people with respiratory illness serious enough to require hospitalization, or (c) people who have been in contact with a person confirmed to have COVID-19. Only on March 5, did the CDC relax the criteria to allow doctors discretion to decide who would be eligible for tests.[11]
As a result, the United States had a slow start in conducting widespread testing for COVID-19.[62][63] Fewer than 4,000 tests were conducted in the U.S. by February 27, with U.S. state laboratories only conducting around 200.[10] The first U.S. case of a person having COVID-19 of unknown origin (a possible indication of community transmission in the state of California) saw the patient's test being delayed for four days after warding in February 19, because he had not qualified for a test under the initial federal testing criteria.[64] Whereas in Washington state, a group of researchers defied a lack of clearance from federal and state officials to conduct their own tests from February 25, using samples already collected from their flu study that their subjects had not given permission for COVID-19 testing. They quickly found a teenager infected with COVID-19 of unknown origin, newly indicating that an outbreak was already occurring in Washington. State regulators stopped these researchers' testing on March 2.[65]
On March 5, Vice President Mike Pence, the leader of the coronavirus response team, acknowledged that ""we don't have enough tests"" to meet the predicted future demand; this announcement came only three days after FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn committed to producing nearly a million tests by that week.[66] Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut and representative Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts both noted that as of March 8, their states had not yet received the new test kits.[67][68] Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged on March 12 that it was ""a failing"" of the U.S. system that the demand for coronavirus tests were not being met; Fauci later clarified that he believed the private sector should have been brought in sooner to address the shortfall.[69] By March 13, fewer than 14,000 tests had been done in the United States, reported The Atlantic.[70]
The timing and availability of testing varies across countries. For example, by March 13 South Korea offered drive-through testing centers, which could get results the next day.[71] South Korea also had a government-funded daily testing capacity of 15,000.[72] According to March 16 and March 17 statistics from Our World in Data, the U.S. had tested 125 people per million of their population - around the same as Japan. The U.K. tested nearly 750 per million, Italy over 2,500 per million, and South Korea over 5,500 per million.[73] The first COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and South Korea were identified at around the same time.[74] Critics say that the US government has botched the approval and distribution of test kits, losing crucial time during the early weeks of the outbreak, with the result that the true number of cases in the United States was impossible to estimate with any reasonable accuracy.[23][75]
As of March 12, all 50 states were able to perform tests, with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs in a state.[76] This was followed by the government announcing a series of measures intended to speed up testing. These measures included the appointment of Admiral Brett Giroir of the U.S. Public Health Service to oversee testing, funding for two companies developing rapid tests, and a hotline to help labs find needed supplies.[77] The FDA also gave emergency authorization for New York to obtain an automated coronavirus test unit that will reduce the testing time to 3.5 hours.[78]
In a press conference on March 13, the Trump administration stated that tests would be conducted in retail store parking lots across the country, with participating franchises including Walmart, Target, CVS, and Walgreens. Trump added that the results would be sent to labs to complete testing in partnership with local health departments and diagnostic labs.[79]  On March 13, drive-through testing in the U.S. began in New Rochelle, Westchester County, as New Rochelle was the U.S. town with the most diagnosed cases at that time.[80]
On March 18, President Trump announced that research groups were looking into self-swab testing that, according to Trump, will be easier, less invasive, and more popular. He expected it to free up health professionals as the test wouldn't need to be administered by health professionals.[81]
There is currently no drug that is approved for treating COVID-19, whether as a therapy or a vaccine. Nor is there any clear evidence that COVID-19 infection leads to immunity, although experts assume it will for a period.[82]
Among the labs working on a vaccine is the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, which has previously studied other infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, Ebola, and MERS. Speed in developing a vaccine is a key element in the midst of the pandemic. By March 18, tests had begun with a few dozen volunteers in Seattle, Washington, which was sponsored by the U.S. government. Similar safety trials of other coronavirus vaccines will begin soon in the U.S. Trials are also underway in China and Europe.[83]
The search for a vaccine has taken on aspects of national security and global competition, giving a nationalistic element to whichever country develops one first. It is assumed that the country which patents it would provide it initially to its own population and subsequently profit from its distribution to other countries.[84]
As for therapies to treat the disease, President Trump has directed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to accelerate the testing and possible use of some unapproved medications to find out if they would help treat coronavirus patients.[85] Among potential drugs, are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have long been used successfully to treat malaria. Both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are currently being used to treat coronavirus patients by a number of physicians with the limited approval of the FDA, which is allowing it as a compassionate use, although still under investigation.[85]
In China, trials of chloroquine are already underway at dozens of clinics, with early laboratory results showing that it seemed to cut down the virus’ rate of replication. Chloroquine has a number of advantages, in that it's already known to be safe in humans (though it can result in poisoning at overdose levels), and has been used to treat patients with malaria for nearly a century. And in pre-clinical research, it has been effective against viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and HIV.[86]
Like chloroquine, the closely-related drug hydroxychloroquine, has already been established as safe for use in humans as it's been on the market since the 1950s to treat certain autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.[86] Doctors are already testing it in COVID-19 patients.[86] Researchers in France have found it be effective after testing it on a small group of 24 patients with coronavirus, with the result that after six days, the virus had disappeared in three-quarters of people treated.[87] On March 20, the WHO announced a large global trial of both drugs.[88]
Because there is little time to fully test the drug, some experts in the U.S. have suggested using it as a first-line treatment. The heads of the FDA and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have been hesitant due to inherent risks. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo planned to study its potential beginning March 24.[89] However, there is currently a shortage of hydroxychloroquine, and some would like the federal government to release any stockpiles it may have and contract with generic manufacturers to ramp up production.[90] The French laboratory, Sanofi, said it had the ability to provide millions of doses, enough to treat 300,000 patients, if it proved effective.[87] And the Israeli company, Teva Pharmaceuticals, said it planned to manufacture and donate ten million doses to U.S. hospitals at no charge.[87]
Also being tested in research clinics is the antiviral drug remdesivir.[85] It was developed to fight Ebola, and although it failed to prove effective, it has since been shown to have some effect against both MERS and SARS.[86] The Feinstein Institute of the Northwell Health system has partnered with Gilead Sciences on phase 3 clinical trials for remdesivir. While remdesivir attacks the virus directly, the Feinstein Institute is also conducting another study on ""a human antibody that may prevent the activity"" of Interleukin 6 (IL-6). The clinical trials are studying whether the drugs can safely and effectively reduce the intensity and duration of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients.[91]
Due to the emergency nature of the pandemic, former FDA commissioners Drs. Scott Gottlieb and Mark McClellan have called for the FDA to develop therapeutics and vaccines that would be exempt from some regulatory requirements.[85]
On March 15, senior federal health official Dr. Anthony Fauci said that the United States had 12,700 ventilators in its national stockpile.[92] On March 19, Vice President Mike Pence declared that the federal government had ""literally identified tens of thousands of ventilators"", but did not provide further details.[93]
On March 16, Trump told state governors that for medical equipment including respirators and ventilators, ""We will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves.""[94] On March 24, Trump said that state governors who wanted help from the federal government ""have to treat us well, also"", because ""it's a two-way street""; he warned against governors arguing ""we should get this, we should get that"".[95]
The Defense Production Act allows the federal government a wide range of powers, including giving directions to industries on what to produce, having companies prioritize certain contracts, allocating supplies, giving incentives to industries, and allowing companies to cooperate. While Trump first signed the act on March 18, he has not used the act to direct industry production, as of March 25. By that date, he had under the act conferred more powers to the Health and Human Services Secretary, and enacted provisions to prevent hoarding of medical resources.[96][97]
On March 18, Trump remarked that that federal government purchased 500 million N-95 masks to make more private masks available and that American manufacturers were repurposing factories to manufacture masks.[98]
By March 21, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security described American hospitals as already facing shortages of test kit reagents, test kit swabs, masks, gowns and gloves.[99]
Bloomberg News reported on March 25 that ventilator manufacturers are facing a shortage of sub-components needed to produce the ventilators.[100]
On March 6, 2020, President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020, approved by both Houses to provide $8.3 billion to fight the pandemic. The deal includes ""more than $3 billion for the research and development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, as well as $2.2 billion for the CDC, and $950 million to support state and local health agencies.""[101][102]
Another bill, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act was approved on March 18. It provides paid emergency leave and food assistance be provided to affected employees, along with free testing.[103]
The U.S. House Committee on Financial Services, chaired by Representative Maxine Waters, released a stimulus proposal on March 18 in which the Federal Reserve would fund monthly payments of ""at least $2,000 for every adult and an additional $1000 for every child for each month of the crisis"". Other elements include suspending all consumer and small business credit payments.[104]
On March 18, Representative Rashida Tlaib proposed the similar ""Automatic BOOST to Communities Act"", which would involve sending pre-loaded $2,000 debit cards to every American, with $1,000 monthly payments thereafter until the economy recovers. This would be funded by the U.S. Treasury minting two trillion-dollar coins. According to Tlaib, the Treasury has this authority, and it would not increase the national debt.[105]
With guidance from the White House, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed a third stimulus package which amounted to over $1 trillion.[a][b][c]
On March 22 and 23, the $1.4 trillion package failed to pass.[d]
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi indicated that the House would prepare its own bill, expected to exceed $2.5 trillion.[e] Early in the morning of March 25, White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland indicated that some consensus had been reached regarding a refined $2-trillion package.[f] Pelosi stated that ""many of the provisions in there have been greatly improved because of negotiation,"" hoping to pass it in the House by unanimous consent.[124] Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated that ""Democrats are ready to give our unanimous consent to speed up the consideration of the bill and get the job done.""[125]
On March 3, 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered target interest rates from 1.75% to 1.25%,[126] the largest emergency rate cut since the 2008 global financial crisis,[127] in an attempt to counteract the outbreak's effect on the American economy. ""The coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" the Federal Reserve said in a statement. ""In light of these risks and in support of achieving its maximum employment and price stability goals, the Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower the target range for the federal funds rate.""[128]
On March 11, during his Oval Office address, Trump announced that he had requested a number of other policy changes:
On March 15, the Fed cut their target interest rate again to a range of 0% to 0.25%.[130] The Fed also announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program similar to the one initiated during the financial crisis of 2007–08. Despite the moves, stock index futures plunged, triggering trading limits to prevent panic selling.[131] The Dow lost nearly 13% the next day, the third-largest one-day decline in the 124-year history of the index.[132] That day, the VIX — informally known as the market ""fear index"" — closed at the highest level since its inception in 1990.[133]
On March 17, the Federal Reserve announced a program to buy as much as $1 trillion in corporate commercial paper to ensure credit continued flowing in the economy. The measure was backed by $10 billion in Treasury funds.[134] At this point, the federal government neared agreement on an economic stimulus proposal totaling about $1 trillion, including direct cash payments to Americans.[135] Trump stated that his administration was working with the Congress to provide rapid relief to affected industries. He remarked that the relief would ensure the American economy would emerge as the strongest on earth. In addition, Trump announced that Small Business Administration would be providing disaster loans that could provide impacted businesses with up to $2 million.[136]
On March 18, Trump announced that the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would be suspending all kinds of foreclosures and evictions until the end of April.[137]
The week of March 19, the Federal Housing Finance Agency ordered federally-guaranteed loan providers to grant forbearance of up to 12 months on mortgage payments from people who lost income due to the pandemic. It encouraged the same for non-federal loans, and included a pass-through provision for landlords to grant forbearance to renters who lost income.[138]
On March 20, Trump announced that the Department of Education will not be enforcing standardized testing for 2020. Trump had also instructed to waive all federally held student loans for the next 60 days, which could be extended if needed.[139] Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also announced that the deadline for all tax filings is moved to July 15.[140]
On March 22, Trump announced that he had directed FEMA to provide four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York, eight large federal medical stations with 2,000 beds for California, and three large federal medical stations and four small federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for the State of Washington.[141]
On March 23, the Federal Reserve announced large-scale expansion of quantitative easing, with no specific upper limit, and reactivation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. This injects newly created money into a variety of financial markets including corporate bonds, exchange-traded funds, small business loans, mortgage-backed securities, student loans, auto loans, and credit card loans. The Fed also lowered its repurchase agreement interest rate from 0.1% to 0%.[142] On the same day, Trump also postponed the October 1, 2020 deadline that required Americans that traveled on commercial airlines to have Real ID compliant identification.[143]
From January 2020 to mid-March 2020, President Trump downplayed the threat posed by the coronavirus to the United States, giving many optimistic public statements,[144] which may have been aimed at calming stock markets.[145] He initially said that he had no worries about the coronavirus becoming a pandemic.[146] He went to state on multiple occasions that the situation was ""under control"", and gave assurances that the country was already overcoming the outbreak. Other repeated suggestions were that the virus would suddenly vanish.[144] He expressed a focus on the number of U.S. cases; commenting about cruise ship Grand Princess, he stated his preference that infected passengers not disembark as he did not want ""to have the [U.S. case] numbers double because of one ship"".[147] He cited the relatively low number of confirmed cases in the initial stages of the outbreak, as proof of success of his travel restriction on China.[147] Eventually in mid-March he rated his administration's response a score of 10/10.[148]
On March 11, 2020, Trump delivered an Oval Office address on national television, just hours after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, which caused a quick fall in financial markets. It was the second such address to the country of his presidency, the first being in January 2019, addressing illegal immigration. In his speech, Trump declared that the United States was ""suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days"", except travel from the United Kingdom, and including ""the tremendous amount of trade and cargo"" (post-speech, Trump stated that trade was still approved, while administration officials clarified that ""American citizens or legal permanent residents or their families"" were not affected). Trump also listed several economic policy proposals, and declared that insurance companies ""have agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments"" (post-speech, America’s Health Insurance Plans clarified the waivers were only for tests, not treatments). Trump praised his administration's response to the ""foreign"" virus while blaming the European Union, stating that ""a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe"".[149]
On March 16, Trump changed his tone on the outbreak to a somber one. For the first time, he acknowledged that the coronavirus was ""not under control"", the situation was ""bad"" with months of impending disruption to daily lives, and a recession might occur.[150] Also on March 16, President Trump and the Coronavirus Task Force released new recommendations based on CDC guidelines for Americans, titled ""15 Days to Slow the Spread.""[151][152] On March 17, ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic.""[153] He also stated that America will achieve total victory against the ""invisible enemy"", and called Americans to sacrifice together.[137]
On March 16, Trump began referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"", and as a result he was criticized by Chinese and WHO officials for creating a potential stigma against Chinese and Asians. Trump disagreed with the criticism, and said that ""China tried to say at one point — maybe they stopped — that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen.""[154][155] Trump stopped using the term on March 23, citing the possibility of ""nasty language"" towards Asian-Americans.[156]
On March 19, Trump promoted the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus, saying, ""...the nice part is, it’s been around for a long time, so we know that if it — if things don’t go as planned, it’s not going to kill anybody.""[157][158] Within days, a sudden shortage occurred for the two drugs, which are also depended on by lupus and rheumatoid arthritis patients to alleviate symptoms and prevent organ damage.[159] A man also died, with his wife in critical condition, after they took chloroquine phosphate, the usual form of chloroquine, which they found as an ingredient in medication for their aquarium fish. The woman said she'd watched Trump's briefing in which he promoted chloroquine as ""basically pretty much a cure"".[160]
On March 22, Trump indicated that he was considering scaling back social distancing measures implemented around a week ago: ""We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself"". A day later, Trump argued that economic problems arising from social distancing measures will cause ""suicides by the thousands"" (without citing evidence) and ""probably more death"" than COVID-19 itself. He declared that the United States would ""soon, be open for business"", in a matter of weeks.[161][162] On March 24, Trump expressed a target of lifting restrictions ""if it's good"" by April 12, the Easter holiday, for ""packed churches all over our country"".[163]
During the early stages of the outbreak, Trump administration officials gave mixed assessments of the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak. CDC Director Robert Redfield said in late January that ""the immediate risk to the American public is low"", then in late February stated it would be ""prudent to assume this pathogen will be with us for some time to come."" While federal economic policy chief Larry Kudlow was declaring the coronavirus spread being contained ""pretty close to airtight"" in late February, Nancy Messonnier (head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases) and Anthony Fauci (head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) warned of the impending community spread of the virus in the United States, with Messonnier stating: ""Disruption to everyday life might be severe"". Around this point, Stephen Hahn, the head of the FDA, warned of national medical supplies being disrupted due to the outbreak. Later in early March, the U.S. Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, declared that ""this is likely going to get worse before it gets better"".[164] In March, while giving public briefings from the White House addressing the pandemic, many administration officials and health experts took time to thank Trump for his leadership, as he watched nearby.[95]
In February 2020, the CDC was notifying the press that it was expecting the infections to spread, and urged local governments, businesses, and schools to develop plans for the outbreak. Among the suggested preparations were canceling mass gatherings, switching to teleworking, and planning for continued business operations in the face of increased absenteeism or disrupted supply chains.[165]
CDC officials warned that widespread transmission may force large numbers of people to seek hospitalization and other healthcare, which may overload healthcare systems.[14] Public health officials stressed that local governments would need assistance from the federal government if there were school and business closures.[67]
On March 23, Surgeon General Jerome Adams made several media appearances, in which he endorsed social distancing measures and warned the country: ""This week, it's going to get bad ... we really, really need everyone to stay at home [...] Every single second counts. And right now, there are not enough people out there who are taking this seriously.""[166]
After mid-March 2020, the Federal government made a major move to use the U.S. military to initiate and lead an effort to rapidly grow COVID-19 intensive care facilities nationwide.
The USACE, under existing statutory authority that comes from authorizations and powers of FEMA, will be rapidly leasing a large number of buildings nationwide in hotels and in larger open buildings to immediately grow the number of rooms and beds with ICU capability for patients of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.  A public briefing of the plan was given by Army General Todd Semonite on March 20, 2020.  USACE will handle leasing and engineering, with contracts for rapid facility modification and setup issued to local contractors.  The plan envisions that the operation of the facilities and the provision of medical staff would be entirely handled by the various U.S. states rather than the Federal government.[17] One of the early and largest buildings to be converted is the Javits convention center in New York City, which was quickly being transformed into a 2000-bed care facility on March 23, 2020.[167]
In addition to the many popup hospitals nationwide, the United States Navy prepared to deploy two hospital ships, USNS Mercy and USNS Comfort, on March 18 to assist potentially overwhelmed counties with acute patient care.[58] Trump stated that the ships were getting ready to go to New York, on the request of Governor Cuomo.[137] On March 22, Trump announced that one ship will go to the East Coast and one will go to the West Coast.[141]
Economic analysts revised their forecasts downward going into March, with Goldman Sachs estimating on March 20 that the economy could contract by as much as 24% during the second quarter of 2020, following their 5% decline estimate just four days earlier. Some analysts estimated a recession had already begun.[168][169][170][171][172]
In mid-March, most major American and foreign airlines began cutting back on domestic and international flights as a result of the sudden drop in travel demand from the pandemic and subsequent travel bans. They have phased out routes and were making frequent schedule updates.[173][174]
The outbreak produced occasional disruptions to air traffic control with area control centers in New York and Indianapolis, and airport towers at Midway International Airport in Chicago and McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas evacuated for sterilization after at least one person who had been in each tested positive for COVID-19.[175]
On March 14, Amtrak reduced its service between Washington and Boston as the coronavirus outbreak drastically decreased travel demand. It faced steep revenue losses during the crisis. It also asked noncritical employees ""to take time off on an unpaid basis.""[176] By the following week, New York's subways, usually the nation’s busiest, were running mostly empty, which had the Metropolitan Transportation Authority using $1 billion from its line of credit to stay afloat.[177]
The lobbying group for the airline industry, Airlines for America (A4A), on March 16 called for a $50 billion subsidy, including $4 billion for cargo services.[178] CNBC reports that airlines are preparing for a ban on domestic flights after President Trump said on March 14 that he is considering travel curbs and acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said all options remained on the table when asked about a possible ban, the first since September 11, 2001. United Airlines said they expected a drop of $1.5 billion in March revenue, American Airlines said they expected to decrease domestic capacity by 20% in April and 30% in May, and Delta Air Lines told employees it would cut capacity by 40%.[179]
Several of the largest mass transit operators in the U.S. have reduced service in response to lower demand caused by work from home policies and self-quarantines. The loss of fares and sales tax, a common source of operating revenue, is predicted to cause long-term effects on transit expansion and maintenance.[180] The American Public Transportation Association issued a request for $13 billion in emergency funding from the federal government to cover lost revenue and other expenses incurred by the pandemic.[181] Many localities reported an increase in bicycling as residents sought socially distant means of getting around.[182][183]
On February 27, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 1,191 points, the largest single-day point drop in the index's history at the time; some attributed the drop to anxiety about the epidemic.[184] The same day, the S&P 500 logged a 4.4% decline.[185] Since then, the record has been beaten five more times during the outbreak on March 9 (-2,013 points), March 11 (-1,465 points), March 12 (-2,353 points), and finally setting the current record for most points lost in a single day by losing 2,997 points on March 16. It once again fell another 1,338 points on March 18. On March 13, the stock market rebounded for the single largest one-day point gain in the market's history by gaining 1,985 points after Trump declared a state of national emergency to free up resources to combat the virus.[186][187] The six business days it took for the S&P 500 Index to drop 10% (from February 20 to 27) ""marked the quickest 10% decline from an all-time high in the index's history.""[185] From January 21 to March 1, the DJIA dropped more than 3,500 points, equating to roughly a 13% decrease.[188][189]
Stock index futures declined sharply during Trump's March 11 address,[190] and the Dow Jones declined 10% the following day — the largest daily decline since Black Monday in 1987 — despite the Federal Reserve also announcing it would inject $1.5 trillion into money markets.[191]
By March 18, investors were shunning even assets considered safe havens during economic crises, such as government bonds and gold, moving into cash positions.[192] By March 20, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was below the level when President Trump was inaugurated on January 20, 2017, having fallen 35% from its February peak.[193]
The number of persons filing for unemployment insurance increased from 211,000 the week ending March 7, to 281,000 for the week ending March 14, an increase of 70,000 or 33%, the largest percent increase since 1992.[194] Just part way through the following week, 15 states had reported nearly 630,000 claims.[195][196] Goldman Sachs forecast that over 2 million people would file the week of March 21, an unprecedented number.[197] Goldman also forecast that the unemployment rate could rise towards 9% over the second and third quarters, with much depending on the specifics of government stimulus plans.[198]
The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic impacted the restaurant industry worldwide via government closures, resulting in layoffs of workers and loss of income for restaurants and owners.
The US restaurant industry was projected to have $899 billion in sales for 2020 by the National Restaurant Association, the main trade association for the industry in the United States.[199] The industry as a whole as of February 2020 employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the workforce directly.[199] It indirectly employed close to another 10% when dependent businesses such as food producers, trucking, and delivery services were factored in, according to Ohio restaurateur Britney Ruby Miller.[199]
On March 15, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and Ohio Health Department director Amy Acton ordered the closure of all bars and restaurants to help slow the spread of the virus, saying the government ""encouraged restaurants to offer carryout or delivery service, but they would not be allowed to have people congregating in the businesses.""[200][199][201] The next day, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland followed suit.[200][202]
Groups of restaurateurs in New York City and Cincinnati called on governments to provide help to the nation's small and independent restaurants.[203][199] On March 19 the New York group called for state governments to issue orders for rent abatements, suspension of sales and payroll taxes, and a full shutdown so that business interruption insurance coverage would be triggered.[204] On March 20 the Cincinnati group called on the federal government to provide a $225 billion bailout to the restaurant industry.[199]
Several restaurant chains altered their operating procedures to prevent the spread of the virus, including removing seating, restricting the use of condiments, and switching to mobile payment systems. Many restaurants opted to close their dining rooms and instead switch to solely take-out food service to comply with physical distancing recommendations.[205]
A number of retailers, particularly grocery stores, reduced their opening hours to allow additional time to restock and deep-clean their stores.[206] Major stores such as Walmart, Apple, Nike, Albertson's, and Trader Joe's also shortened their hours.[207][208] Some grocery store chains, including Stop & Shop and Dollar General, devoted a portion of their operating hours to serve only senior citizens.[209][210]
To prevent hoarding, many supermarkets and retailers placed limits on certain products such as toilet paper, hand sanitizer, over-the-counter medication, and cleaning supplies.[211] However, the Food Marketing Institute announced that its supply chain was not strained and all products would be available in the future.[211] Major retail chains started hiring tens of thousands of employees to keep up with demand, including Walmart (150,000), CVS Pharmacy (50,000), Dollar General (50,000), and 7 Eleven (20,000).[212]
Since consumers were increasingly relying on online retailers, Amazon planned to hire another 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers and raise wages $2 per hour through April. They also reported shortages of certain household staples.[213]
A March 21 article in the Chicago Tribune reported that employees at UPS, FedEx, and XPO often have been pressured not to take time off, even with symptoms such as fever and cough consistent with Coronavirus.  Public health authorities state that the risk is relatively low to customers receiving packages, in part because Coronavirus does not live for very long on cardboard, but it most certainly is a danger for employees on crowded conveyor belts.[214]
At its warehouses, Amazon has stopped exit screenings, as well as group meetings at the beginning of shifts, and has staggered shift times and break times.  The company also announced it would provide up to two weeks of pay to all employees diagnosed with coronavirus or placed into quarantine, but presumably not for employees who merely have symptoms of fever and cough.[215]
In response to shortages, some alcoholic beverage facilities started manufacturing and distributing alcohol-based hand sanitizer.[216] General Motors opened its manufacturing, logistics, and purchasing infrastructure for use by Ventec, a manufacturer of medical ventilators.[217]  As medical mask manufacturers hired hundreds of new workers and increased output,[218] in response to urgent requests from hospital workers, volunteers with home sewing machines started producing thousands of non-medical masks that could be sterilized and re-used. Fabric was bought privately or donated by Joann Fabrics.[219] The CDC recommended the use of homemade masks (preferably in combination with a full-face splash shield) only as a ""last resort"" when no other respiratory protective technologies were available, including reused professional masks.[220]
In February 2020, the American companies Apple Inc. and Microsoft began lowering expectations for revenue because of supply chain disruptions in China caused by the virus.[221] In a February 27 note to clients, Goldman Sachs stated that it expects no earnings growth for U.S. companies in 2020 as a result of the virus, at a time when the consensus forecast of Wall Street expected ""earnings to climb 7%.""[222] On March 20, 2020 as part of an SEC filing, AT&T cancelled all stock buyback plans included a plan to repurchase stock worth $4 billion during the second quarter. The reasons AT&T gave for the cancellation was to invest the money into its networks and in taking care of its employees during the pandemic.[223]
The pandemic, along with the resultant stock market crash and other impacts, has led to increased discussion of a recession in the United States.[224] Experts differ on whether a recession will actually take place, with some saying it's not inevitable while others say the country may already be in a recession.[224][225] Of the economists surveyed in March by the University of Chicago at multiple U.S. universities, 51% agreed or strongly agreed that there would be a ""major"" recession caused by the coronavirus, while 31% were uncertain or disagreed.[226]
In response to the economic damage caused by the pandemic, some economists have advocated for financial support from the government for individual Americans and for banks and businesses.[227][228] Others have objected to intervention by the government on the grounds that it would alter the role of the Federal Reserve and enshrine moral hazard as a defining market principle.[229]
In order to minimize the spread of infection, public health officials and political figures have initiated steps to isolate infected patients, impose quarantines, and recommend or require physical distancing during group activities, including the closing of schools, retail stores, workplaces, sports events, and leisure activities such as dining and movies.
In extreme instances, a number of cities and states have imposed lockdown measures which limit where people can travel, work and shop away from their homes:
Similar restrictions to varying degree have been imposed in Illinois, Texas, Nevada, New Jersey and Florida, including the shutting down of hotels.[230]
As of March 24, 2020[update], 124,000 public and private schools had closed nationwide, affecting at least 55 million students, with most schools in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all five inhabited territories closed statewide.[232] To ensure food-insecure students continued to receive lunches while schools were closed, many states and school districts arranged for ""grab-and-go"" lunch bags or used school bus routes to deliver meals to children.[233] To provide legal authority for such efforts, the U.S. Department of Agriculture waived several school lunch program requirements.[234]
A large number of higher educational institutions canceled classes and closed dormitories in response to the outbreak, including Harvard University, Cornell University, and the University of South Carolina.[235][236][237] Virtually all colleges and universities have extended remote classes until the end of the spring semester and several have proactively cancelled graduation ceremonies.[citation needed]
Due to the disruption to the academic year caused by the coronavirus, the U.S. Department of Education approved a waiver process, allowing states to opt-out of standardized testing required under the Every Student Succeeds Act.[238] In addition, the College Board eliminated traditional face-to-face Advanced Placement exams in favor of an online exam that can be taken at home.[239] The College Board also cancelled SAT testing in March and May in response to the pandemic.[240] Similarly, April ACT exams were rescheduled for June 2020.[241]
The Department of Education also authorized limited student loan relief, allowing borrowers to suspend payments for at least two months without accrueing interest.[238]
As COVID-19 was spreading to several prisons in the US, some states and local jurisdictions began to release prisoners considered vulnerable to the virus.[242]
There have been widespread incidents of xenophobia and racism against Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans.[243] It had been reported that Asian Americans had been purchasing firearms in response to the xenophobia arising from the pandemic.[244] ABC News reports on March 23, 2020, that the FBI has issued a report saying that white extremist groups and neo-Nazis are encouraging their members to spread the coronavirus to Jews and police officers.[245]
As ""social distancing"" entered the public lexicon, emergency management leaders encouraged the cancellation of large gatherings to slow the rate of infection.[citation needed] Technology conferences such as Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC),[247] E3 2020,[248] Facebook F8, Google I/O and Cloud Next,[249] and Microsoft's MVP Summit[250][251] have been either cancelled or have replaced in-person events with internet streaming events.
On February 21, Verizon pulled out of an RSA conference, joining the ranks of AT&T Cybersecurity and IBM.[252] On February 29, the American Physical Society cancelled its annual March Meeting, scheduled for March 2 to 6 in Denver, Colorado, even though many of the more than 11,000 physicist participants had already arrived and participated in the day's pre-conference events.[253] On March 6, the annual South by Southwest (SXSW) conference and festival scheduled to run from March 13 to 22 in Austin, Texas, were cancelled following after the city government declared a ""local disaster"" and ordered conferences to shut down for the first time in 34 years.[254][255] The cancellation is not covered by insurance.[256][257] In 2019, 73,716 people attended the conferences and festivals, directly spending $200 million and ultimately boosting the local economy by $356 million, or 4 percent of the annual revenue of the region's hospitality and tourism economic sectors.[258][259]
After the cancellations of the Ultra Music Festival in Miami and SXSW in Austin, speculation began to grow about the Coachella festival set to begin on April 10 in the desert in Indio, California.[260][261] The annual festival, which has attracted some 125,000 people over two consecutive weekends, is insured only in the event of a force majeure cancellation such as one ordered by local or state government officials. Estimates on an insurance payout range from $150 million to $200 million.[262] On March 10, event organizers announced the festival had been postponed to October.
The scale of the coronavirus outbreak has prompted several major publishers to temporarily disable their paywalls on related articles, including Bloomberg News, The Atlantic, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Seattle Times.[263][264]
Several alt weekly newspapers in affected metropolitan areas, including The Stranger in Seattle and Austin Chronicle, have announced layoffs and funding drives due to lost revenue. Public events and venues accounted for a majority of revenue for alt-weekly newspapers, which was disrupted by the cancellation of large public gatherings.[264][265]
Most U.S. cinema chains, where allowed to continue operating, reduced the seating capacity of each show time by half to minimize the risk of spreading the virus between patrons.[266] Audience limits, as well as mandatory and voluntary closure of cinemas in some areas, led to a total North American box office sales the lowest since October 1998.[267] On March 16, numerous theater chains temporarily closed their locations nationwide.[268] A number of Hollywood film companies have suspended production and delayed the release of some films.[269][270]
In March, a number of studio-based talk shows and game shows announced plans to film behind closed doors with no audience.[271]  Some television networks and news channels have adjusted their programming to incorporate coverage of the pandemic and adhere to CDC guidelines, including encouraging remote work and physical distancing on-air (including separation between on-air anchors and increased use of remote interviews).[272][273][274]
Quarantine and remote work efforts, as well as interest in updates on the pandemic, have resulted in a larger potential audience for television broadcasters, especially news channels. Nielsen estimated that by March 11, television usage had increased by 22% week-over-week. It was expected that streaming services would see an increase in usage, while potential economic downturns associated with the pandemic could accelerate the market trend of cord cutting.[275][276][277]
A suspension of games for various time periods has been announced by almost all professional sports leagues in the United States, including the National Basketball Association,[278] National Hockey League,[279] Major League Baseball,[280] and Major League Soccer.[281][282]
Several colleges announced on March 10 that attendance at university athletic events would be temporarily limited to essential personnel such as media, players, coaches, and recruits.[283][284][285] On March 12, the NCAA shut down its annual men's and women's basketball tournaments[286] along with wrestling championships.[287] It marked the first time that the men's basketball tournament would not be conducted in its 81-year history.[288][289]
Organizers of the 2020 Indian Wells Masters tennis tournaments cancelled the games, noting that attendance in the last two years was around 450,000.[290] The ATP Tour and WTA Tour have both suspended competition until late-April, which has also led to the cancellation of the Miami Open.[291] NASCAR on March 13 postponed the races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and announced on March 16 that it will postpone all race events until May 3.[292] The IndyCar Series similarly announced the cancellation of all races through the end of April.[293] The PGA Tour played the first round of the 2020 Players Championship on March 12, and stated that subsequent rounds and tournaments would be held without spectators,[294] but later cancelled the rest of the tournament and subsequent events.[295] The LPGA Tour has postponed ANA Inspiration.[296] On March 13, Augusta National Golf Club announced that it would postpone the Masters Tournament.[297]
The local and statewide stay-at-home orders of late March did not make exceptions for public worship services.
By March 20, every Roman Catholic diocese in the United States had suspended the public celebration of Mass and dispensed with the obligation to attend Sunday Mass, as had the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter. The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in the United States also suspended public Divine Liturgies.[298][299][300][301][302][303][304]
Opinion polling showed a significant partisan divide regarding the outbreak.[305] NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist found in their mid-March survey that 76% of Democrats viewed COVID-19 as ""a real threat"", while only 40% of Republicans agreed; the previous month's figures for Democrats and Republicans were 70% and 72% respectively.[306] A mid-March poll conducted by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal found that 60% of Democrats were concerned someone in their family might contract the virus, while 40% of Republicans expressed concern. Nearly 80% of Democrats believed the worst was yet to come, whereas 40% of Republicans thought so. About 56% of Democrats believed their lives would change in a major way due to the outbreak, compared to 26% for Republicans.[307] A mid-March poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 83% of Democrats had taken certain precautions against the virus, compared to 53% of Republicans. The poll found that President Trump was the least-trusted source of information about the outbreak, at 46% overall, although 88% of Republicans expressed trust in the president, second only to their trust in the CDC.[308] A March 22 poll conducted by Gallup shows that 60% of Americans polled approved Trump's handling of the situation. The poll also found that his approval rating is increased by 5 point to 49%.[309][310]
The United States has experienced pandemics and epidemics throughout its history, including the 1918 Spanish flu, the 1957 Asian flu, and the 1968 Hong Kong flu pandemics.[313][314][315] In the most recent pandemic prior to COVID-19, the 2009 H1N1 swine flu took the lives of over 12,000 Americans and hospitalized over 200,000 more.[316][317][313] Because of this pandemic and the 2014 Ebola epidemic, which saw only a small number of Americans infected,[318] the Obama Administration increased planning and analysis that focused on deficiencies in the government's response to outbreaks.[317] In 2017, outgoing Obama administration officials briefed incoming Trump administration officials on how to respond to pandemics by using simulated scenarios, although by the time of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., around two-thirds of Trump administration officials at the briefing had left the administration.[317]
The United States Intelligence Community, in its annual worldwide threat assessment reports of 2017 and 2018, stated new types of microbes that are ""easily transmissible between humans"" remained ""a major threat."" Similarly, for the 2019 worldwide threat assessment, the U.S. intelligence agencies warned that ""the United States and the world will remain vulnerable to the next flu pandemic or large-scale outbreak of a contagious disease that could lead to massive rates of death and disability, severely affect the world economy, strain international resources, and increase calls on the United States for support.""[319][320]
Citing lessons learned from the swine flu pandemic, Ebola outbreak, and the 2001 anthrax attacks, President Trump released a National Biodefense Strategy on September 18, 2018 in response to a Congressional directive.[321][322][323][324] According to Trump, the new strategy was designed to strengthen the nation’s defenses against disease outbreaks and bioterrorism and to make responses to them more efficient and better coordinated.[321][322] Concurrently, he released a National Security Presidential Memorandum that appointed the Secretary of HHS Alex Azar to oversee implementation of the government’s new biodefense strategy and directed National Security Advisor John Bolton to assist in reviewing and improving the nation’s biodefenses.[325][326][321] At a time when multiple agencies and departments shared responsibility for biodefense,[324] Bolton and Azar claimed this centralization of primary authority for biodefense in the HHS would provide greater accountability.[327]
In 2018, Bolton reorganized the executive branch's United States National Security Council, largely merging the group responsible for global health security and biodefense into a bigger group responsible for counter-proliferation and biodefense. Along with the reorganization, the leader of the global health security and biodefense group, Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer, left to join another federal agency, while Tim Morrison became the leader of the combined group.[328][329] Also in 2018, Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert left the administration; reportedly at Bolton's request. Bossert had helped to create the Trump administration's biodefense plans, and it was his responsibility to coordinate the government's response in the event of a biological crisis.[330] Bossert's successor, Doug Fears, and Fears' successor Peter J. Brown, took over the biodefense responsibilities of the DHS. Bloomberg News reported in January 2020 that biodefense was by then a ""less prominent"" part of the Homeland Security Advisor's responsibilities.[331][332]
In other departures, Dr. Luciana Borio, the National Security Council director for medical and biodefense preparedness, left her post in March 2019. The Washington Post reported in March 2020 that the White House would not confirm the identity of Borio's replacement.[328] Meanwhile, in July 2019, Dr. Linda Quick, a US CDC expert working within the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, left her post without a replacement, as her position would have been eliminated in September 2019 due to the China–United States trade war. Reuters reported Quick's departure in March 2020; her role was training Chinese field epidemiologists to respond to disease outbreaks at their hotbeds; the post had existed since 2007 or earlier.[333]
The Trump administration from January to August 2019 simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China and found that the U.S. government response was ""underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated,"" with the ""not to be disclosed"" draft report detailing repeated cases of ""confusion"" during the exercises. A briefing was given to the United States Congress in December 2019 of some of the findings from the exercise, including the conclusion that the U.S. could not speedily manufacture certain medical supplies to cope with demand, because many of these items were imported. In response to the problems illustrated in the simulation, Trump issued an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the HHS.[334]
Despite all these activities, National Geographic reported that as of March 3, 2020 the ""U.S. has only a fraction of the medical supplies it needs to combat coronavirus."" An additional 300 million N95 respirators (face masks) and surgical face masks could be required to protect health workers. However, in Senate testimony, U.S. HHS Secretary Alex Azar stated that ""the Strategic National Stockpile has just 30 million surgical masks and 12 million respirators in reserve."" HHS said that it intends to purchase as many as 500 million respirators and surgical face masks over the next 18 months. A previous 2015 CDC study found that seven billion N95 respirators might be necessary to handle a ""severe respiratory outbreak [such as COVID-19].""[335] The New York Times reported on March 18 that about 170,000 ventilators (devices to help patients breathe) were in the U.S., versus an American Hospital Association estimate that 960,000 people may need them during the pandemic. The shortage of ventilators is one reason why slowing the spread of the virus is so important. Ramping up production is challenging due to global supply chains and the complexity of the devices, with major U.S. hospitals having trouble finding more.[336] Bloomberg News reported on March 23 that: ""NY Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state, which has about 5,000 to 6,000 ventilators, might need 30,000 of them."" China is significantly increasing ventilator production to assist other countries, with plans to supply about 14,000 non-invasive ventilators in April. The U.S. government has also called on U.S. manufacturers to assist.[337]
Confirmed COVID-19 cases by county (as of March 24, 2020[update])
The following numbers are based on CDC data. However, CDC data is incomplete. In most U.S. locations, testing for some time was only performed on symptomatic people with a history of travel to Wuhan or with close contact to such people.[20][339][340] A quarantined nurse in California, showing symptoms of COVID-19 but without a travel history, said she was denied testing by the CDC in early March.[341] CDC testing protocols did not include non-travelling patients with no known contact with China until February 28.[342]
The original CDC-developed tests sent out on February 5 turned out to be faulty.[343] On February 29, the FDA announced that labs would be allowed to do their own in-house testing immediately, independently of CDC testing, as long as they complete an emergency use authorization (EUA) within 15 days.[343] In Washington, state regulators at one point told health care workers to stop testing previously collected samples from an existing non-COVID19 flu study.[344]
As of March 18, the CDC reported that 37,824 specimens had been tested for COVID-19, 4,484 of which were tested by CDC labs, and 33,340 tested by U.S. public health labs.[345]
The CDC publishes official numbers every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, reporting several categories of cases: individual travelers, people who contracted the disease from other people within the U.S., and repatriated citizens who returned to the U.S. from crisis locations, such as Wuhan, where the disease originated, and the cruise ship Diamond Princess.[400]

An ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to Canada on January 27, 2020, after a man returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan. As of March 24, 2020[update], there have been 2,746 confirmed cases in Canada, 185 recoveries, 26 deaths,[1] and over 80,000 tests performed.[citation needed]
Most of those cases are in British Columbia (472 cases, 13 deaths),[2] Ontario (505 cases, 6 deaths),[3] and Quebec (1,013 cases, 4 deaths).[4] Confirmed cases have been reported in 12 of Canada's 13 provinces and territories, with Nunavut being the only remaining territory without a confirmed case. An additional 13 cases involve repatriated citizens from the Grand Princess cruise ship.[5][6][7][8] Until March, all cases were linked to recent travel to a country with a substantial number of cases. The first case of community transmission in Canada was confirmed in British Columbia on March 5,[9]  and Toronto's chief health officer announced on March 16 that there is ""some evidence of community transmission"".[10]
In mid-March, all of Canada's provinces and territories declared states of emergency. Most provinces and territories have also implemented school and daycare closures, prohibitions on large gatherings, as well as the closure of various leisure and entertainment venues.[11] On March 16, Canada severely restricted its border access, barring travellers from all countries except the United States; on March 18, travellers from the United States were also banned in a mutual agreement with the US government (with exceptions in place for family members, essential employees who commute across the border and to ensure continued exchange of goods). Travellers entering Canada have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days. This requirement is legally enforced in Saskatchewan, as well as in Newfoundland and Labrador for both international and domestic travellers. The weekend of March 21–22, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island announced screening at all ports of entry, including the bridge to PEI, and inbound travel was banned from the Northwest Territories.[12]
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for the virus on March 12 and she and Trudeau went into self-isolation.[13][14]

On January 15, the federal government activated its Emergency Operations Centre.[16]
On January 17, the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) implemented signage in the Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver airports to raise awareness of the virus, and had added a health screening question to the electronic kiosks for passengers arriving from central China. There are no direct flights from Wuhan to Canada.[17][18]
On January 23, the federal Minister of Health, Patty Hajdu, said that five or six people were being monitored for signs of the virus.[19][20]
On January 25, the first identified presumptive case in Canada was a male in his 50s who travelled between Wuhan and Guangzhou before returning to Toronto on January 22.[21] Canada issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to China due to the outbreak, including a regional travel advisory to avoid all travel to the province of Hubei.[22] Federal health officials stated that the risk in Canada was low.[23] Final testing conducted at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba confirmed the presumptive case on January 27.[24]
On January 29, Minister of Foreign Affairs François-Philippe Champagne announced that an aircraft would be sent to repatriate Canadians from the areas affected by the virus in China.[25]
On February 2, the Canadian Armed Forces announced that it planned to charter a plane to assist in the evacuation of Canadian nationals still in Wuhan once given authorization by China, intending to fly them to CFB Trenton for repatriation and medical screenings. Only those that had entered the country with a Canadian passport would be allowed to take this flight.[26] The first plane landed at CFB Trenton on February 7.[27] On February 21, a chartered flight of 131 Canadians who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess after an outbreak on the cruise ship in Japan, and who all tested negative for the virus, were brought to CFB Trenton for additional screening before being transported by bus to the NAV Centre in Cornwall, Ontario to be quarantined.[28]
On February 26, Hajdu recommended that citizens stockpile food and medication, noting that it was ""good to be prepared because things can change quickly [in any emergency].""[29] The recommendation faced criticism from politicians: Manitoba health minister Cameron Friesen and Ontario health minister Christine Elliott both felt that there was no need for such aggressive stockpiling, while Friesen also felt that there needed to be more coordination between the federal and provincial levels in terms of information regarding the outbreak.[30][31] Conservative Party shadow minister Matt Jeneroux opined that the suggestion incited concern and was lacking in transparency. Health Canada's website recommended against such bulk purchases (as to not strain supply chains), and explained that having supplies on hand was to ""ensure you do not need to leave your home at the peak of the outbreak or if you become ill.""[31][32]
Hajdu announced on March 6 that the federal government would offer $27 million in funding to 47 research groups at 19 universities, to develop means of managing the outbreak. Minister of Finance Bill Morneau stated that the next federal budget would include measures in response to the outbreak, including an increase to the risk adjustment provision.[33][34][35]

Venezuela ,"
During the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, the first two patients with the novel coronavirus disease were confirmed in Venezuela on 13 March 2020.[3][4] As of 22 March, this number has risen to 77.[5]
Venezuela is currently vulnerable to the epidemic because of an ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis which caused massive shortages of food staples and basic necessities, including medical supplies. In addition, the mass emigration of Venezuelan doctors has caused hospitals to deal chronic staff shortages.[6] As a precaution, the governments of Brazil and Colombia have temporarily closed their borders with Venezuela.[7][8][9]
The Ministry of Popular Power for Health announced that the Rafael Rangel National Institute of Hygiene (Spanish: Instituto Nacional de Higiene Rafael Rangel) in Caracas would perform the detection of other respiratory viruses based on non-influenza types, including coronaviruses in humans. It is also the only health institute in the country with the installed capacity for the diagnosis of respiratory viruses in Venezuela and is able carry out logistics in the 23 states, the Capital District and the Federal Dependencies.[10]
In February 2020, the Venezuelan government announced that the country had imposed epidemiological surveillance, restrictions and diagnostic system to detect possible coronavirus patients at the Simón Bolívar International Airport in Maiquetía, Venezuela's main international airport, and that Venezuela would receive a diagnostic kit for the virus strain from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO).[11]
On 12 March, President Nicolás Maduro had already declared a public health emergency in the country and suspended all inbound flights from Europe and Colombia for 30 days. Maduro also announced that public gatherings were suspended and that the government would be evaluating whether or not to suspend flights from other regions in the coming weeks. According to him, there had been 30 suspected cases in Venezuela, but they were ruled out after tests.[26]
After the first cases in the country were confirmed, Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez asked all the passengers of the 5 and 8 March Iberia 6673 flight to enter immediately in a mandatory preventive quarantine since the two cases were from this flight.[27]
Rodríguez announced that all classes would be suspended at public and private schools from Monday 16 March until further notice,[28] while Minister Néstor Reverol announced that the government would provide border control authorities with face masks, gloves and thermometers, without mentioning supplies for citizens and hospitals.[4] Reverol also announced that the operational control of all the police forces would be transferred to the Armed Forces in order to coordinate the action and contigency plan.[29]
On 14 March, authorities arrested two people for spreading false information about the virus, recording a video about fake cases in Los Teques.[30] SUDEBAN, the government's intendency related to banks and financial institutions, announced the suspension of banking activities effective from 16 March.[31]
Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced that, effective from 16 March, the Armed Forces would control the access to the six states and the Capital District declared by Nicolás Maduro to be in quarantine.[32]
On 16 March, Maduro reversed the official position against the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and asked the institution for a funding of US$5 billion to combat the pandemic,[33] a first during Maduro's presidency who has been a critic of the institution.[34][35] IMF also has had conflicts with the Bolivarian government in the past, as Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chávez had pledged to cut ties with the fund in 2007, and the IMF suspended US$400 million in special drawing rights during the Venezuelan presidential crisis in 2019.[36] The IMF rejected the deal as it was not clear, among its member states, on who it recognizes as Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro or Juan Guaidó.[37] According to a report by Bloomberg, Maduro administration also tried to request aid of $1 billion to the IMF, after the first request was denied.[38]
On 19 March, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez announced that 4,000 diagnosis kits were delivered from China to test for coronavirus. The government said that the Chinese diagnosis kits would benefit 300,000 Venezuelans and thanked the Chinese government and its paramount leader Xi Jinping for its generosity. In a separate measure, Venezuela's INEA maritime authority has prohibited crews aboard ships docking in the country's ports from disembarking.[39] The same day, President Maduro announced that he received a letter from the United Nations (UN) Resident Coordinator and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative Peter Grohmann, confirming that the organization ""is ready to support the Venezuelan government in its fight against COVID-19."" Maduro stressed that the UN has taken concrete actions, particularly in the areas of health and water, sanitation and hygiene, and ""will support the Ministry of Health in the care and containment of the coronavirus."" Likewise, they will offer support in the disclosure of reliable and updated information.[40]
On 20 March, President Maduro said that Russia was considering ""a significant donation of special humanitarian aid"" to the country, such as medical equipment and kits for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and is expected to arrive by next week.[41] On 23 March, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza and Russian ambassador Sergei Melik-Bagdasarov announced that 10,000 diagnosis kits were delivered from Russia, with more to be supplied in future shipments.[42] In a tweet, President Maduro thanked the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin for their generosity and for standing in solidarity with the Venezuelan people.[43]
Disputed National Assembly leader and disputed acting president Juan Guaidó said that the country is experiencing one of the most serious health crises in its history caused by the inactions of the Maduro government and announced a series of measures in order to take ""responsible measures against the pandemic.""[44][45] These include the postponement of opposition protests and the creation of the Special Health Commission.[8][44] In addition, Guaidó also called for the entry of humanitarian aid from the United Nations while explaining that health services are not impacted by international sanctions.[45]
The Committee of Electoral Candidacies, in charge of appointing a new National Electoral Council (CNE), announced that it would suspend its meetings because of the pandemic.[46]
Julio Castro [es], head of the Special Health Commission appointed by Juan Guaidó, informed that face masks are a prevention measure useful only for at least one day, that once used the mask loses its effectiveness and can become an infection source, and declared that Venezuelans have to take additional measures to deal with the pandemic.[47]
National Assembly deputy Jesús Yánez announced that the government of Taiwan donated 1,000 surgical masks as a measure to prevent the coronavirus pandemic. The masks were distributed in five stations of the Caracas Metro (Plaza Sucre, Pérez Bonalde, Plaza Venezuela, Chacao and Petare). Yánez highlighted that the metro is a means of transportation used by a large part of the population and is a breeding ground for the pandemic due to the crowding of people in closed spaces if any positive case should become known.[48]
Guaidó's Special Health Commission collected 3,500 protection kits for caregivers at five hospitals on 16 March.[49]
On 21 March, Guaidó announced that he delivered medical kits to protect the health sector from the coronavirus pandemic. On his official Twitter account, he shared a video expressing that “We are protecting a sector that today is giving everything: the health sector, our doctors and nurses. To support them is to support us all. We must bring this help to hundreds who need it."" and concluded “We can contain this emergency. Venezuela is in our hands. #AuxilioParaVzla.""[50]
[51]
Baltazar Porras, Apostolic Administrator of Caracas, announced the suspension of ecclesiastic activities on 15 March, while assuring that temples would remain open and asking Venezuelans to avoid crowded places and to remain calm.[52]
Maduro asked to not politicize the pandemic,[53] while he expressed concern as to how the country would control the pandemic because of the United States sanctions.[3] Maduro called on US President Donald Trump to lift the sanctions so the country could acquire necessary medical supplies.[54]
The Venezuelan Medical Federation condemned that a medic in Zulia had to leave to Colombia after denouncing the situation in Venezuela for the presence of the virus,[55] and asked for the release of the political prisoners in the country, who are vulnerable to the virus, specifically Roberto Marrero, Juan Requesens and other lawmakers.[56]
In the Anzoátegui state, nurses denounced the lack of face masks, gloves and disposable gowns on 16 March.[57]
The United States Embassy in Venezuela rejected claims from Nicolás Maduro and Jorge Arreaza that sanctions are preventing the government from purchasing medical supplies, saying that “medicines, medical supplies, spare parts and components for medical devices in Venezuela, or to people from third countries who buy specifically for resale from Venezuela are excluded from the sanctions.""[58][59] Days later, Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza rejected the claims, calling the statements ""the height of impudence and falsehood."" He reiterated that Venezuelan government assets worth more than US$5 billion were blocked, in addition to ""Venezuela's ban on access to the international banking system"".[60]
Former Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz declared that Maduro ""lied"" when saying that there were no medicines in the country because of the sanctions, saying that the reasons were incompetence and corruption.[61] The US Acting Assistant Secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs Michael Kozak also accused Maduro of lying, saying that U.S. sanctions never block food or medicine purchases. He emphasized that shortages in Venezuela resulted from ""the regime’s theft of the nation’s wealth.""[62][63]
Economist Francisco Rodríguez declared that the sanctions ""severely harm the capacity of affected countries"" to respond to the pandemic.[64][unreliable source?]
On 19 March, the Chinese Embassy in Caracas rejected the accusations made by National Assembly deputies against China, by calling the pandemic as ""China or Wuhan virus."" In a statement, the embassy ""strongly rejects the attacks and unfounded and arbitrary accusations of some Venezuelan deputies to China.""[65]
On 24 March, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet called for any sanctions imposed on Venezuela and other countries facing the pandemic such as Cuba, Iran, and Zimbabwe to be ""urgently reevaluated"" in order to avoid pushing strained medical systems into collapse. In a statement, Bachelet said: ""At this crucial time, both for global public health reasons, and to support the rights and lives of millions of people in these countries, sectoral sanctions should be eased or suspended.""[66][67] Bachelet also accentuated the need to protect health workers in these countries as authorities should not punish professionals that point out the deficiencies in the state response to the crisis.[66]
International concern was raised before the first cases were reported, as Venezuela's health care system has completely collapsed due to the ongoing crisis, meaning its already suffering population is especially vulnerable to the spread of a pandemic.[6]
Per the Global Health Security Index, Venezuela's health system is ranked among the worst in the world in its ability to detect, quickly respond, and mitigate a pandemic.[68] Hospitals are plagued by chronic shortages of supplies, including eye protectors, gloves, masks, and soap.[69] Due to ongoing shortages of resources, hospitals must also constantly deal with chronic lack of staff, thus making the response to treating a large number of infected patients significantly more challenging.[69] Patients are also often turned away at hospitals due to overcrowding, or asked to bring in their own gauze, IV solution, or syringes, while there are often no hygiene facilities like toilets, and power outages are a regular occurrence.[6]
The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said that it would be prioritizing Venezuela alongside Haiti and other Central and South American countries because of “challenges to their health systems.”[4]
Associated Press reported that experts are worried that the Venezuelan refugee crisis could worsen the spread of the virus.[8]
Reuters reported that Venezuela's notoriously overcrowded and unsanitary prisons could spread the coronavirus ""like a fast-moving fire."" Venezuelan prisons frequently lack bathrooms, people sleep on floors, and many inmates spend their days without shirts or shoes on, in part to combat the infernal heat of windowless facilities.[70] This has caused US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to demand the Maduro government release six Citgo executives, held in prison since 2017, on humanitarian grounds.[71][72] Pompeo said that all six men have weakened immune systems and ""face a grave health risk if they become infected"" with the coronavirus pandemic.[72]
On 18 March, four cases were extraofficially reported in El Helicoide, three women and a male officer of the motorized brigade of the National Police.[73][74]
Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional, reported a total of 65 cases for 20 March, according to undisclosed sources from the Health Ministry.[75] On that day the ministry did not report any official numbers,the numbers were officially updated the next day going from 42 to 70.[76] Similarly, before the official report on 23 March, El Nacional reported 84 cases according undisclosed source from the Health Ministry.[77]
Cases per federal entity as of 24 March 2020:[78]
Efecto Cocuyo pointed out that 24 March report differs from 23 report, as Táchira and Portuguesa that reported cases before, were no longer included.[79]
As of 18 March, the female-male ratio of confirmed cases was 1:1.[18][80]
As of 22 March, the ratio was 37:40.[81]

the United Kingdom ,"

The ongoing global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), spread to the United Kingdom in January 2020.[4] Transmission within the UK was confirmed in February,[5] leading to an epidemic with a rapid increase in cases in March.[6] As of 23 March, after testing 83,945 people, there have been 6,650 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK,[nb 3][3] and 335 people with confirmed infection have died.[nb 1][3]
On 12 January the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was responsible for a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.[12] The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease.[13] The four UK Chief Medical Officers (CMOs) raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January, upon the WHO's announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).[13] After cases appeared in the UK on 31 January a public health information campaign was launched to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus.[13] Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to introduce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020 statutory instrument.[12] Guidance on infection prevention and control, how to detect and diagnose COVID-19, and daily updates, including advice to travellers, have been published by the UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England (PHE).[12] In addition, the NHS set up COVID-19 drive-through screening centres at some hospitals.[14][15] The Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government, Chris Whitty explained a four-pronged strategy to tackle the outbreak: contain, delay, research and mitigate.[16]
The earliest documented transmission within the UK occurred on 28 February 2020; all of the cases detected previously had been infected abroad.[5] By 1 March, cases had been detected in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.[12][17] Subsequently, Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled the Coronavirus Action Plan,[12] and the government declared the outbreak a ""level 4 incident"".[18] On 11 March, the WHO declared the outbreak a pandemic.[6] Other responses included some schools in England choosing to close.[19] Airlines announced a number of flight cancellations,[20] and some online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders.[21] On 12 March, the UK risk level was raised from moderate to high.[22] Four days later, following the catastrophe in Italy,[23] whose health system shares similar values and organisation as the NHS,[24] and based on evidence including forecasting by epidemiologists at Imperial College London,[25] the government advised on further measures on social distancing and advised people in the UK against ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others, as well as suggesting people should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, and work from home if possible. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70, and those with certain health conditions were urged to consider the advice ""particularly important"", and were asked to self-isolate.[23] On 18 March, it was announced that the UK will close schools to most students, with children of key workers and vulnerable children still able to attend.[26] On 20 March, all restaurants, pubs, clubs and indoor sport and leisure facilities were ordered to close, though delivery and take-out chains were allowed to remain open.[27] On 23 March, the government announced that these measures were to be tightened further, with wide-ranging restrictions made on freedom of movement, enforceable in law.[28]
On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019. This cluster was initially linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City. However, some of those first cases with laboratory confirmed results had no link to the market, and the source of the epidemic is unknown.[29][30]
Unlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19, a disease also classified as a high consequence infectious disease (HCID),[31][32] has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.[33][31] COVID-19 typically appears with about seven days of flu-like symptoms followed by some people progressing to symptoms of a viral pneumonia requiring admission to hospital.[31]
On 22 January, following a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the United States the previous day, in a man returning to Washington from Wuhan, China, where there were 440 confirmed cases at the time, the DHSC and PHE raised the risk level from ""very low"" to ""low"". As a result, Heathrow Airport received additional clinical support and tightened surveillance of the three direct flights that it receives from Wuhan every week; each were to be met by a Port Health team. In addition, all airports in the UK were to make written guidance (in English, Mandarin, and Cantonese) available for unwell travellers.[35][36] Simultaneously, efforts to trace 2,000 people who had flown into the UK from Wuhan over the previous 14 days were made.[37]
On 31 January, two members of a family of Chinese nationals staying in a hotel in York, one of whom studied at the University of York, became the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK. Upon confirmation, they were transferred from Hull University Teaching Hospital to a specialist isolation facility, a designated High Consequence Infectious Diseases Unit in Newcastle upon Tyne.[4][38]
On the same day, an evacuation flight from Wuhan landed at RAF Brize Norton and the passengers, none of whom were showing symptoms, were taken to quarantine, in a staff residential block at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral.[39] There had previously been contention over whether the government should assist the repatriation of UK passport holders from the most affected areas in China, or restrict travel from affected regions altogether.[40][41] Some British nationals in Wuhan had been informed that they could be evacuated but any spouses or children with mainland Chinese passports could not.[42] This was later overturned, but the delay meant that some people missed the flight.[39]
On 6 February, a third confirmed case, a man who had recently travelled to Singapore prior to visiting a ski resort in the Haute-Savoie, France, was reported in Brighton. He had been the source of infection to six of his relatives during a stay in France, before returning to the UK on 28 January.[43][44] Following confirmation of his result, the UK's CMOs expanded the number of countries where a history of previous travel associated with flu-like symptoms – such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing – in the previous 14 days would require self-isolation and calling NHS 111. These countries included China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.[45]
On 10 February, the total number of cases in the UK reached eight as four further cases were confirmed in people linked to the affected man from Brighton.[46][47] Globally, the virus had spread to 28 countries.[48] On the morning of 10 February, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, announced the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020, to give public health professionals ""strengthened powers"" to keep affected people and those believed to be a possible risk of having the virus, in isolation.[48] That day, the Arrowe Park Hospital, Merseyside, and the Kents Hill Park hotel and conference centre, Milton Keynes became designated isolation units.[12][48] The following day, two of the eight confirmed cases in the UK were reported by BBC News to be general practitioners.[46] A ninth case was confirmed in London on 11 February.[49]
On 23 February, the DHSC confirmed a total of 13 cases in the UK as four new cases in passengers on the cruise ship Diamond Princess were detected. Two were transferred to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, one to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and one to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne.[50]
On 27 February, the total number of confirmed cases in the UK were reported as 16, including the first case in Northern Ireland – a woman who had travelled from the outbreak area in northern Italy, having also stopped in Dublin.[51][52]
On 28 February, the first case in Wales was confirmed in a person who had returned from Northern Italy, and then transferred to a specialist NHS infection centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London.[53][54][55] The same day, two further cases were confirmed in England, one of whom was a man who was taken to Guy's and St Thomas' and who became the 20th case of COVID-19 in the UK and the first case who did not contract the disease from abroad. He was a resident in Surrey and registered at the Haslemere Health Centre, which had previously been closed for ""deep cleaning"".[5]
On 29 February, three further cases of the virus were confirmed bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 23, after testing 10,483 people.[12] The three cases are from Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and Berkshire. Two of the three affected people had recently returned from Italy while the third had come back from Asia.[56] On the same day, Scottish CMO, Catherine Calderwood announced that surveillance would begin at some hospitals and 41 GP surgeries in Scotland.[57]
442,675 calls were made to the non-emergency line 111 in the last week of February.[58]
On 1 March a further 13 cases were reported, adding Greater Manchester and Scotland to the list of areas affected and bringing the total to 36, three of which are believed to be contacts of the case in Surrey who had no history of travel abroad.[59][60]
On 2 March, four further people in England tested positive. All four had recently travelled from Italy; they are from Hertfordshire, Devon and Kent.[12] The total number of UK cases was reported as having reached 40, though this was revised to 39 after additional testing.[20] The following day, when the total number of confirmed cases in the UK stood at 51, the UK Government unveiled their Coronavirus Action Plan, which outlines what the UK has done already and what it plans to do next.[12]

Later that day 6 new cases were discovered in Wales, bringing the total to 25. Meanwhile, the total of cases in the UK was reported to be 590.[12] On the same day, the UK CMOs raised the risk to the UK from moderate to high.[22] The government advised that anyone with a new continuous cough or a fever should self-isolate for seven days. Schools were asked to cancel trips abroad, and people over 70 and those with pre-existing medical conditions were advised to avoid cruises.[72][73]
On 13 March, the number of confirmed cases rose by 208 to 798 confirmed cases,[74] with the first death from Coronavirus being reported in Scotland.[75] Many sporting fixtures including the London Marathon,[76] the Six Nations Wales vs Scotland fixture,[77] and all Premier League and EFL football games[78] were postponed and the 2020 United Kingdom local elections were postponed for a year.[79] Similarly, the Country to Country music festival due to take place between 13–15 March at London's O2 Arena was also postponed.[80] The UK Government restricted the export of three drugs being administered to Covid-19 patients in clinical trials in China: Kaletra, Chloroquine Phosphate, and Hydroxychloroquine  [81]
On 14 March, the number of confirmed cases rose to 1,140 and the total number of people who had died in the UK had increased to 21.[82]
On 15 March, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock announced that everyone in Britain over the age of 70 would be told to self-isolate ""within the coming weeks"".[83] That day, the number of cases rose to 1,372 and the number of deaths increased to 35.[84]
On 16 March, the UK death toll rose to 55, with the number of cases of the illness passing 1,500.[23] The deaths included the first to be reported in Wales.[85] Also on 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised everyone in the UK against ""non-essential"" travel and contact with others, as well as suggesting people should avoid pubs, clubs and theatres, and work from home if possible. Pregnant women, people over the age of 70 and those with certain health conditions were urged to consider the advice ""particularly important"", and would be asked to self-isolate within days.[23] On the same day, the second Member of Parliament was diagnosed with the virus. The new Labour MP for Jarrow, County Durham Kate Osborne tested positive after a period of self-isolation.[86][87][88][89]
On 17 March, NHS England announced that all non-urgent operations in England would be postponed from 15 April to free up 30,000 beds.[90] Also on 17 March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that £330bn would be made available in loan guarantees for businesses affected by the pandemic.[91][92] On that day the UK death toll rose to 71, while the number of confirmed cases increased to 1,950.[93][94]
On 18 March, Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown Lloyd Russell-Moyle announced that he had tested positive for with the virus, becoming the third MP to be diagnosed with the disease.[95]
On 19 March, the first death was confirmed in Northern Ireland.[96] The Ministry of Defence also announced the formation of the COVID Support Force, enabling the military to support public services and civilian authorities in tackling the outbreak.[97] Two military operations were also announced; Operation Rescript, which focuses on the outbreak in the United Kingdom, and Operation Broadshare, which focuses on British military activities overseas.[98]
Confirmed cases in Sheffield rose to 36 by 20 March, the highest for a UK city outside of London at that point.[99]
On 20 March, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency announced that all pending practical and driving theory tests were to be postponed, for at least 3 months in the case of practical tests, and up to and including 20 April for theory tests. All candidates were to receive notification of when their tests were rescheduled.[100][101]
On 22 March the UK death toll reached 281, including what was reported to be the virus's youngest British victim so far, an eighteen-year-old with underlying health problems.[102]
On 23 March, Next was the latest retailer to announce that it was temporarily closing its 700 stores due to the pandemic. It predicted a £1bn loss in revenue due to the virus.[103][104] On the same day, Downing Street confirmed Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is the ""designated survivor"" to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson if he became ""incapacitated"" due to COVID-19. The clarification comes after the issue was raised by MP Peter Bone.[105]
On the evening of 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in a television broadcast that measures to mitigate the virus were to be tightened further in order to protect the NHS, with wide-ranging restrictions made on freedom of movement, enforceable in law,[28] for a planned ""lockdown"" period intended to last for at least three weeks.[106]
The government directed people to stay at home throughout this period except for essential purchases, essential work travel (if remote work is not possible), medical needs, one exercise per-day (alone or with members of their household), and providing care for others.[107] Many other non-essential activities, including all public gatherings and social events except funerals, are prohibited, with many categories of retail businesses ordered to be closed.[28][108]
On 24 March, text messages containing a notice informing of these restrictions were sent to all wireless service customers in the country. The campaign was performed in cooperation with the country's wireless providers; in 2013, the government endorsed the use of Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), a system implemented in other countries that can send emergency messages to all mobile phones via a mass broadcast separate from text messages, as an ""effective way of getting people to take specific protective action during an emergency"". Although it has been tested by the UK government, it has never actually been implemented, with Toby Harris citing internal disputes over who would fund and operate such a system.[109][110]
According to official data released on 24 March, there had been 87 new coronavirus deaths in the previous 24 hours, bringing the total number of deaths to 422.[111]
Shortly after confirming that the cause of the cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan was a new coronavirus, Chinese authorities had shared its genetic sequence for international developments of diagnostic kits.[35] The UK subsequently developed a prototype specific laboratory test for the new disease, performed on a sample from the nose, throat, and respiratory tract and tested at PHE's Colindale laboratories in London.[48] By 3 February, 326 tests had been performed in the UK.[13] Over the following few weeks, PHE made the test available to 12 other laboratories in the UK, making it possible to test 1000 people a day.[48]
Following 300 staff being asked to work from home on 26 February 2020 in London, while a suspected person was awaiting a test result for the virus, PHE announced it was to increase surveillance by widening testing around the UK to include people with flu-like symptoms at 100 GP surgeries and eight hospitals: the Royal Brompton and Harefield, Guy's and St Thomas' and Addenbrookes Hospital, as well as hospitals at Brighton and Sussex, Nottingham, South Manchester, Sheffield, Leicester.[112][113] Surveillance was shortly extended to some hospitals and GP surgeries in Scotland.[57]
Drive-through screening centres were set up by Central London Community Healthcare NHS Trust at Parsons Green Health Centre on 24 February 2020,[14] and by NHS Lothian at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh.[15] A further drive-through testing station was set up by the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust at a site just off the A57 Sheffield Parkway dual-carriageway on 10 March; in this case, patients ringing NHS 111 with coronavirus-like symptoms in the Sheffield area will be told to drive, if possible, to the testing centre at an allotted time.[114]
On 11 March NHS England announced that testing in NHS laboratories would increase from testing 1,500 to 10,000 per day.[69] The test consists of taking a sample from the nose, throat, deeper lung samples, blood or stool, and transporting the packed samples to the listed PHE regional laboratory designated for the referring laboratory region.[115][116] As of 12/13 March 2020, 29,764 tests had been conducted in the UK, corresponding to 450.8 tests per million people.[117]
Reports from the Medical Research Council's Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College, London have been providing mathematically calculated estimates of cases and cases fatality rates.[48][118] In February, the team at Imperial, led by epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, reported about two-thirds of cases in travellers from China were not detected and that some of these may have begun ""chains of transmission within the countries they entered.""[119][120][121] This translates to only one in three cases coming into the UK being detected.[122] They forecast that the new coronavirus could infect up to 60% of the UK's population, in the worst-case scenario.[123]
In a paper released but not yet published on 16 March, the Imperial team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US.[25][124] Their paper details the potential outcomes of an array of 'non-pharmaceutical interventions' such as contact tracing and case isolation, home self quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.[25] On the same day as the report was published, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.[23][124]
Guidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.[43] In February, Chief Medical Adviser to the UK Government, Chris Whitty explained ""we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain; the second of these is to delay; the third of these is to do the science and the research; and the fourth is to mitigate so we can brace the NHS.""[16] These aims equate to four phases; specific actions involved in each of these phases are:
The four UK CMOs raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January 2020, upon the World Health Organization's announcement of the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[12][13] As soon as cases appeared in the UK on 31 January 2020, a public health information campaign, similar to the previous ""Catch it, Bin it, Kill it"" campaign, was launched in the UK, to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus.[13] Travellers from Hubei province in China, including the capital Wuhan were advised to self-isolate, ""stay at home, not go to work, school or public places, not use public transport or taxis, ask friends, family members or delivery services to do errands"",[127] and call NHS 111 if they had arrived in the UK in previous 14 days, regardless of whether they were unwell or not.[13] Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to announce the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020.[12] Daily updates have been published by the DHSC.[12] NHS Digital in the meanwhile, have been collecting data.[128]
On 25 February 2020, the UK's CMOs advice for all travellers (unwell or not) who had returned to the UK from Hubei province in the previous 14 days, Iran, specific areas designated by the Italian government as quarantine areas in northern Italy and special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, to self-isolate and call NHS 111.[45] This advice was also advocated for any person who has flu-like symptoms with a history of travelling from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and areas in Italy north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini, returning to the UK since 19 February. Later, self-isolation was recommended for anyone returning from any part of Italy from 9 March.[12][45]
Initially Prime Minister Boris Johnson largely kept Britain open, resisting the kind of lockdowns seen elsewhere in Europe. On Friday 13 March, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told BBC Radio 4 that one of ""the key things we need to do"" is to ""build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission"".[129] This involves enough people getting infected, upon which they develop immunity to the disease.[130][131] Vallance said that 60% of the UK's population will need to become infected for herd immunity to be achieved.[132][131] This stance was criticised by experts who said that it would lead to hundreds of thousands deaths and overwhelm the NHS. Over 200 scientists urged the government to rethink the approach in an open letter.[133] Subsequently, Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied that herd immunity was a plan for the UK, although the Department for Health and Social Care said that ""herd immunity is a natural byproduct of an epidemic"".[134]
On 2 March, Boris Johnson said in an interview with BBC News: ""The most important thing now is that we prepare against a possible very significant expansion of coronavirus in the UK population"". This came after the 39th case in the UK was confirmed and over a month after the first confirmed case in the UK.[135] The same day, a BBC One programme Coronavirus: Everything You Need to Know addressed questions from the public on the outbreak.[136] The following day, the Coronavirus Action Plan was unveiled.[12] The next day, as the total number of cases in the UK stood at 51, the government declared the coronavirus outbreak as a ""level 4 incident"",[18] permitting NHS England to take command of all NHS resources.[18][137] Planning has been made for behaviour changing publicity including good hygiene and respiratory hygiene (""catch it, bin it, kill it""),[138] a simple measure which helps in delaying the peak of the infection and buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines.[126] Primary care has been issued guidance.[139]
Public Health England has also been involved with efforts to support the British Overseas Territories against the outbreak.[140][141]
The government published the Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020[142] on 10 February 2020, a statutory instrument covering the legal framework behind the government's initial containment and isolation strategies and its organisation of the national reaction to the virus. Other published regulations include changes to Statutory Sick Pay (into force on 13 March),[143] and changes to Employment and Support Allowance and Universal Credit (also 13 March).[144]
On 19 March, the government introduced the Coronavirus Bill 2019–21, which would grant the government discretionary emergency powers in the areas of the NHS, social care, schools, police, the Border Force, local councils, funerals and courts.[145] The bill is expected to pass all stages of parliamentary consideration on 23 March.[146]
Closures to pubs, restaurants and indoor sports and leisure facilities were imposed via the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Business Closure) (England) Regulations 2020.
The government held daily evening press conferences starting on 17 March and broadcast on BBC One. These were mostly hosted by Boris Johnson with cabinet ministers (often Matt Hancock) and senior scientific advisors.[147]
On 24 March, all major mobile telephony providers, acting upon a government request, sent out an SMS message to each of their customers, with advice on staying isolated.[148] This was the first ever use of the facility.[148]
In March, hospitals begin to prepare for the cancellation of all non-urgent elective procedures.[149]
On 22 March, the government announced that it would be asking about 1.5 million people (everyone in the country with certain health conditions that carry serious risk if infected) to self-isolate for 12 weeks. They were to be notified by mail or text messaged by their NHS general practitioners, and provided deliveries of medication, food, and household essentials, delivered by pharmacists and local governments, and at least initially paid for by the national government.[150]
Also on 22 March the NHS took over (at cost) almost the entire private health system, bringing 8,000 beds, 20,000 medical staff and 1,100 ventilators into the project.[151]  Existing ventilator stocks stood at 5,900 at the beginning of the outbreak, and the government had also acquired stocks from the armed forces and suppliers, buying all they can supply.
In addition to the 2.5 million masks already bought and distributed the Matt Hancock said that another 1 million masks had been bought.
On 24 March 2020, the NHS announced plans to open a 2-ward, 4,000-bed temporary hospital in the ExCeL centre in East London,[152] named NHS Nightingale Hospital.[153]
In March 2020, the Ministry of Defence announced the formation of the COVID Support Force, a 20,000 strong military support force to support public services and civil authorities in tackling the virus.[97] Two military operations; Operation Rescript, based in the UK, and Operation Broadshare, focused on overseas defence activities, were launched.[98] 150 military personnel began receiving training to drive oxygen tankers for the NHS.[97] The Telegraph reported Chief of the Defence Staff Nick Carter had ordered the military to prepare for a ""six month"" operation.[154] The armed forces had previously been used to assist the government in bringing British citizens home from affected areas, such as China and Japan.[155] On 22 March, the Royal Air Force reportedly assisted repatriation flights of British and EU citizens from Cuba.[156] The Guardian reported that training exercises, including those overseas in Canada and Kenya, had been cancelled to free up personnel for the COVID Support Force.[157] Several air shows, including the Royal International Air Tattoo at RAF Fairford, were also cancelled.[158]
The Royal Air Force began using Birmingham Airport to practise transferring Coronavirus patients to local hospitals via helicopter.[159][160] A critically ill patient was also transported from the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Shetland to an intensive care ward in Aberdeen by an RAF Airbus A400M Atlas aircraft.[161]
On 24 March 2020, military planners helped plan a field hospital in East London, named the Nightingale Hospital, which would be staffed by the military, alongside the NHS.[162]
From the latter half of January, Heathrow Airport received additional clinical support and tightened surveillance of the three direct flights that it receives from Wuhan every week; each were to be met by a Port Health team.[35] Later, airlines including British Airways and Ryanair announced a number of flight cancellations for March.[20]
Regional airline Flybe had been brought to the brink of collapse following prior financial trouble earlier in the year. This, combined with decreased ticket sales as a result of the outbreak, caused the airline to stop ticket sales on 4 March 2020.[163][164] The company entered administration and ceased operations the following day.[165][166]
Despite some calls for a bailout, led namely by Virgin Atlantic, the Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said that the government would only come into the picture as ""a last resort""[167][168].
On 20 March, Southeastern became the first train operating company to announce a reduced timetable, which would come into use from 23 March.[169] On that day the government announced emergency measures to safeguard the nation's rail network, with season ticket holders given refunds if working from home, and rail franchise agreements nationalised for at least six months to prevent train operating companies from collapsing.[170][171]
On 19 March, the Stagecoach Supertram light rail network in Sheffield announced that they would be switching to a modified Sunday service from 23 March until further notice.[172] Local bus operators First South Yorkshire and Stagecoach Yorkshire, which operate across the same area, announced that they would also be switching to a reduced timetable from 23 March.[173]
Transport for London (TfL) services are being reduced in stages. All Night Overground and Night Tube services, as well as all services on the Waterloo & City line, were suspended from 20 March, and 40 tube stations were closed on the same day.[174] The Mayor of London and TfL urged people to only use public transport if absolutely essential, so that it can be used by critical workers.[175] A further reduction in service from 23 March will affect London Overground, TfL Rail, Docklands Light Railway and London Trams services.[citation needed]
It was reported in The Guardian that British supermarkets and their suppliers had developed a plan to ensure a consistent supply of a range of basic goods if there was panic-buying by consumers. Tesco, the country's largest supermarket chain, was said to have carried out simulation exercises to plan for events such as a pandemic flu outbreak which could be used to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.[21] There have been reports of hand sanitiser and anti-bacterial products selling out at some supermarkets.[176] Online retailers reported consumers placing unusually large orders while the managing director of the frozen food chain Iceland reported increased sales of ""multibuy deals and larger packs"".[21]
Some supermarkets and other shops responded by limiting the amount customers brought of popular items, whilst others had a blanket limit across their entire range.[177][178] Sainsburys announced on 18 March that they would introduce a dedicated shopping hour for elderly and disabled customers, as well as giving them priority for online deliveries.[179] Other supermarkets, such as Iceland and Morrisons also introduced measures.[180] Sainsbury's further announced on 21 March that they would give healthcare workers allocated shopping hours on three mornings a week, along with elderly and vulnerable customers.[181]
Amazon stopped sellers from sending non essential products to their warehouses and Selfridges closed all its stores, however customers can still buy their products from their website.[182]
In response to the panic buying of food, Professor Stephen Powis, medical director at NHS England, said on 21 March that NHS staff were being deprived of food supplies because of the activities of some consumers, and urged people to shop responsibly. Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium said that there was enough food in the supply chain, but that the issue was getting it to retailers quick enough, suggesting the food industry was experiencing ""a peak in demand"" like at Christmas, but ""without the four-month build-up period."" She added that that an extra £1bn had been spent on food in the preceding three weeks.[183] Environment Secretary George Eustice also urged shoppers to stop panic buying.[184] On the same day it was reported that Tesco, Asda, Aldi, and Lidl had begun a recruitment drive for up to 30,000 new staff.[185]

The governor of the Bank of England called on the British government to provide support to businesses affected by the  virus[192] and was reported to be working with the Treasury to provide a stimulus package to prevent the British economy falling into recession.[193] Companies listed on the London stock markets have fallen in value with commentators citing worries about the virus.[194] To stimulate the economy, the Bank of England cut interest rates from 0.75 to 0.25 percent.[195] On 19 March, the interest rate was again cut this time to 0.10% – the lowest rate in the bank's 325-year existence.[196]
Following cases in Italy, the Cransley School in Northwich, Cheshire, and Trinity Catholic College in Middlesbrough closed, as some of their pupils had returned with symptoms from Italy. Fourteen schools in England had closed by 28 February.[19] Loughborough University reported a student confirmed to have the virus after recent travel to Italy, and indicated that several staff members and students began self-isolation.[197]
Cambridge University was heavily criticised for their incoherent response to the pandemic which forced international students and staff to scramble to make arrangements to return home with only two days' notice. On 13 March, students and staff were advised that international travel was discouraged and university facilities would stay open at reduced capacity. However, on 18 March, Vice Chancellor Stephen Toope announced a sudden U-turn and all university buildings would be indefinitely shut from all staff and students from the afternoon of Friday 20 March onwards, and all students are strongly encouraged to leave Cambridge.[198] The president of Cambridge UCU criticised that this sudden shutdown will exacerbate the pandemic as students from countries with weaker healthcare provisions are forced to return home.[198] Over a thousand Cambridge students signed an open letter requesting to have multiple assessment options in lieu of the cancelled examinations in Cambridge, including the option to retake part or all of the academic year in 2020–21.[199]
Coventry University first suspended all graduation ceremonies due to be held in March and April,[200] and from 20 March, suspended all face-to-face teaching, in favour of on-line delivery.[201] Many other higher education institutions took similar steps at around the same time.[202]

There have been reports of hate incidents against Italian and Chinese persons[210] and a Singaporean student was assaulted in London in an attack that police linked to coronavirus fears.[211] On 17 March trials lasting longer than three days were postponed until May in England and Wales, while Scottish courts were not starting any new trial indefinitely. In England and Wales those cases already running would continue in the hope of reaching a conclusion.[212][213]
The government released specific guidance to prisons in the event of coronavirus symptoms or cases, specifically the rule that ""any prisoner or detainee with a new, continuous cough or a high temperature should be placed in protective isolation for 7 days"".[214]
On 14 March, a prison officer in HMP High Down in Surrey tested positive for the virus and was sent home to self-isolate. Four officers who had contact with him were placed in isolation as a precaution.[215] On 18 March, the first coronavirus case was reported within the UK prison population. The prisoner, who had been serving time in HMP Manchester (commonly referred to as Strangeways), was moved to a hospital. While no other prisoners or staff tested positive for the virus, thirteen prisoners and four members of staff were put into isolation as a precaution.[216] Prison visits remained open, but the situation is being monitored.[217]  On 19 March, it was revealed that around 75 officers at HMP Berwyn in Wales were off work due to sickness or self-isolation, and 22 prisoners showing symptoms of coronavirus were being isolated by the prison. However, the prison had enough staff members to remain fully operational.[218] Another prison officer tested positive on 20 March at HMP Whitemoor near March, Cambridgeshire.[219]
Following the case in HMP Manchester, public services think tank Reform called for the release of 2,305 ""low-risk"" offenders on short sentences to reduce the risk of coronavirus on the prison population.[220] Their report argues that prison are ""overcrowded [with] insanitary conditions and poor-quality healthcare"".[221] Similar actions have been taken in Iran and the United States.[222] Former justice secretary David Gauke echoed similar sentiments, citing the ""churn"" of prisoners going in and out of prison as a risk.[223]
On 23 March, a prisoner tested positive for the virus at HMP Birmingham and was placed into isolation. The prison was not placed into full lockdown, but made the decision to restrict access.[224] On the same day, a prisoner at HMP Oakwood near Wolverhampton tested positive for the virus and was placed into isolation.

To contain the spread of the virus the Premier League announced on 6 March an end to pre-match fair play handshakes between players and officials.[229] On 10 March, the Premier League match between Manchester City and Arsenal was postponed in light of confirmation that Nottingham Forest and Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis had contracted the virus. Marinakis had met with several Arsenal players when the London side hosted Olympiacos in a Europa League round of 32 match.[230] On 10 March the four-day Cheltenham Festival continued as planned with enhanced hygiene measures in place,[231] as did the All England Open Badminton Championships in Birmingham the next day.[232]
On 12 March it was announced that Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta had tested positive to COVID-19,[233] and the next day Chelsea midfielder Callum Hudson-Odoi became the first Premier League player to test positive for coronavirus.[234] Professional football was later suspended across the United Kingdom on 13 March, with the Premier League, English Football League, Women's Super League, and Welsh and Northern Irish football leagues delaying matches until the beginning of April[235] and the Scottish Professional Football League suspending matches indefinitely.[236] Professional football in England was later postponed until the end of April.[237] The day also saw the cancellation of the Wales–Scotland Six Nations match scheduled for 14 March[238] and the postponement of the London, Manchester and Brighton Marathons from their April dates until the autumn.[239]

Ontario ,"
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Ontario is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case of COVID-19 in Canada during the 2019–20 worldwide pandemic occurred in the Canadian province of Ontario, and was confirmed on January 27, 2020, after a man returned to Toronto from travel in China, including Wuhan. As of March 23 at 10:30 a.m. ET, there have been 588 confirmed cases, 8 recoveries, and 7 deaths.[1][2][3] Overall 28,506  people have been approved for testing, with 19,586 people (97.5%) testing negative and 588 people (2.5%) testing positive,[1] the remaining people are still waiting on their test results due to a backlog in testing.[4][5]
On March 17, the Government of Ontario declared a state of emergency,[6] closing bars and restaurants (with the exception of take-out and delivery services), as well as libraries, theatres, cinemas, schools and daycares and all public gatherings of more than 50 people.[3] Furthermore, the government announced on March 17 that Ontario had ""some evidence of community transmission"" of COVID-19.[7]
On January 23, the first presumptive case in Canada was admitted to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto and placed into a negative pressure chamber.[8][9] The patient, a male in his 50s who travelled between Wuhan and Guangzhou before returning to Toronto on January 22, contacted emergency services following rapid onset symptoms.[10] The presumption of infection in the patient was made after a rapid test was done at Public Health Ontario's Toronto laboratory. Final testing conducted at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba confirmed the presumptive case on January 25.[8][9] Authorities said that the patient was experiencing respiratory problems but was in stable condition.[8] His condition later improved and he was released from hospital on January 31.[11]
On January 27, the Chief Medical Officer of Health of Ontario announced the man's wife as the second presumptive case.[12] Officials reported that she was in good condition and that she was asymptomatic.[12]
On January 31, the third case in Ontario (and the fourth case in Canada) was reported in the city of London.[13] Officials said that the individual, a woman in her 20s and a student at University of Western Ontario, returned from Wuhan on January 23.[14] She was asymptomatic and had tested negative at first, but additional advanced testing confirmed that the woman had low levels of the virus in her system.[14] Officials said that the individual wore a mask during her voyage and she voluntarily entered self-isolation upon her return, making a full recovery after two or three days.[14] On the same day, the Government of Ontario reported that 17 cases were under investigation within its provincial jurisdiction.[15] Officials said that most of the individuals under investigation were awaiting results while in self-isolation at home.[16] As of January 30, the associate medical officer of Ontario said that the province had conducted a total of 67 tests with 38 negative results.[16] Officials said that all possible cases—including previous negative results—were being retested as additional assessments become available.[14]

The woman was tested locally with a positive test result and the sample was sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.[19] On February 24, health officials in Ontario stated that all three previous cases in Ontario were ""resolved"", which means patients had two consecutive negative test results 24 hours apart and that the ""system was working"".[19]
On March 5, Ontario reported three more cases of the virus, for a total of 23 in the province, with cases in Toronto, Kitchener, and Mississauga being reported.

Hamilton reported 23 cases[40] and Ottawa 19 cases,[41] Durham reported 18 cases[42]
and Waterloo Region reporting 14 cases.[43]
Updated as of March 24, 2020 (all regions with more than 10 cases are reported; not all regions are reported)
Ontario has announced they have a dedicated web page updated 3 times daily with the cumulative total and new cases.[1]  In addition, they have been making new releases as cases are confirmed, with their source whether they are due to travel history or close contact.[44] The Ontario Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, Christine Elliott has been overseeing the emergency plan for the virus.[45]
On March 12, the Government of Ontario announced publicly funded schools would be closed for an additional two weeks after March Break until April 5.[46]

On March 18, The Toronto Star reported that test results announced by the provincial government were several days old, with turnaround times increasing from 24 hours to 4 days, leading the government to ""making decisions based on old information"".[4] The same story reported that the government's goal of performing 5,000 tests per day may be two weeks away.[4] The province was only able to process around 2000 tests per day by March 19, which caused the backlog.[5]
The backlog increased to over 8,000 unprocessed samples on March 24 with patients waiting at least four days for results, partially due to fact that private and university laboratories are not allowed to process samples.[61]
"
Israel ,"
The first case of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Israel was confirmed on 21 February 2020 after a female citizen tested positive for coronavirus disease 2019 at the Sheba Medical Center after return from quarantine on the Diamond Princess ship in Japan.[2] As a result, a 14-day home isolation rule was instituted for anyone who visited South Korea or Japan, and a ban was placed on non-residents and non-citizens who were in South Korea for 14 days before their arrival.[3] On 11 March, Israel limited gatherings to 100 people.[4] On 15 March, gatherings were limited to 10 people, with attendees advised to keep a distance of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) between one another.[5] On 19 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency, saying that existing restrictions would henceforth be legally enforceable, and violators would be fined. Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. Essential services—including food stores, pharmacies, and banks—would remain open. Restrictions on movement were further tightened on 24 March as well as the stoppage of public transportation for one week's time.
The pandemic comes amid the absence of an official government, as no ruling coalition has been formed following the 2020 Israeli legislative election, the third since the dissolution of the government in December 2018. Netanyahu continues to act as prime minister and has been accused of usurping additional powers in the effort to monitor and contain the spread of the virus.
On 20 March, an 88-year-old Holocaust survivor in Jerusalem who suffered from previous illnesses was announced as the country's first casualty.[6][7]
On 21 February, Israel confirmed the first case of COVID-19.

On 27 February, a man, who had returned from Italy on 23 February, tested positive and was admitted to Sheba Medical Center.[11] On 28 February, his wife also tested positive.[12]
On 1 March, a female soldier tested positive for the virus. She had been working at the toy store managed by the same man diagnosed on 27 February.[13] On 3 March, three more cases were confirmed. Two contracted the virus at the same toy store: a high school student who worked at the store, and a deputy principal of a school who shopped there. Following this, 1,150 students entered a two-week quarantine. One other person, who had returned from a trip to Italy on February 29, also tested positive for the virus.[13]
On 26 January 2020, Israel advised against non-essential travel to China.[14] On 30 January, Israel suspended all flights from China.[15] On 17 February, Israel extended the ban to include arrivals from Thailand, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.[16]

[27] 4,073 citizens voted in the coronavirus-special voting booths. After the election, numerous Israelis were in quarantine.[28]
On 15 March, Justice Minister Amir Ohana expanded his powers and announced that non-urgent court activity would be frozen. As a result, the corruption trial of Prime Minister Netanyahu was postponed from 17 March to May 24. The Movement for Quality Government urged the Attorney General to stay the new regulations.[29]
On 15 March, the Israeli government proposed allowing the Shin Bet security service to track the prior movements of people diagnosed with coronavirus through their mobile phones. The security service would not require a court order for its surveillance. The stated goal of the measure was to identify other people with whom infected individuals came in contact for the two weeks prior to their diagnosis, and to dispatch text messages informing those people that they must enter the 14-day self-quarantine. The security measure was to be in place for only 30 days after approval by a Knesset subcommittee, and all records were to be deleted after that point. Critics branded the proposal as an invasion of privacy and civil liberties.[30][31]
On 17 March, at 1:30AM, a Knesset committee approved the phone tracking program.[32] Within the first two days, the Ministry of Health text-messaged 400 individuals who had been in proximity to an infected person and told them to enter a 14-day self-quarantine.[33] On March 19, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Adalah – The Legal Center for Arab Minority Rights, and the Joint List political alliance of Arab parties filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Israel to halt the monitoring program.[33] The same day, several hundred protesters converged on the Knesset to protest the phone surveillance and other restrictions on citizens' movements, as well as the shutdown of the judicial and legislative branches of the government. Police arrested three protesters for violating the ban on gatherings over 10 people, and also blocked dozens of cars from entering Jerusalem and approaching the Knesset building.[34]

By the third week in March, El Al, Israel's national air carrier, responded to a government request to send rescue flights to Peru, India, Australia, Brazil and Costa Rica to bring home hundreds of  Israelis who were stranded around the world due to the worldwide pandemic. On 22 March, 550 Israelis returned from India; a few days before about 1,100 Israeli travelers were repatriated from Peru.[39]

On 11 March, Israel began limiting gatherings to 100 people.[40]
On 14 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu addressed the public, announcing new regulations and stating the need to ""adopt a new way of life"". The Health Ministry posted new regulations, effective 15 March.

The list of venues required to close included malls, restaurants, hotel dining rooms, pubs, dance clubs, gyms, pools, beaches, water and amusement parks, zoos and petting zoos, bathhouses and ritual baths for men, beauty and massage salons, event and conference venues, public boats and cable cars, and heritage sites. Take-away restaurants, supermarkets and pharmacies were to remain open.[41] The Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock closed to upend contamination from holy sites.[42]
As a result of the government's directive for citizens to remain at home, there has been an increase in calls to domestic violence hotlines and women's shelters are close to full capacity, both due to new arrivals and to current residents who have remained due to the pandemic.[43]

Public bus operations were strictly curtailed by the government, which placed an 8 p.m. curfew on bus operations nightly, and halted all public transportation between Thursday night at 8 p.m. and Sunday morning[46], going beyond the usual hiatus on public transportation in Israel during Shabbat (from Friday evening to Saturday evening). 
As of 22 March Israel's Ministry of Transportation and its National Public Transportation Authority instituted a notification system allowing passengers using public transportation to inquire whether they have shared a ride with a person sick with Covid-19. The travel histories will be stored through the use of the country's electronic bus card passes, known as Rav-Kav.[47]
On 9 March, after it was discovered that an employee at the Israeli embassy in Greece had also contracted coronavirus and spread it to two family members, it was announced that the embassy was temporarily shutting down.[48]
The pandemic forced many events to be cancelled. Notwithstanding the closure of wedding halls, weddings took place in private homes with the requisite 10 participants in each room; dancing took place both indoors and in outdoor courtyards. Weddings were also held on rooftops and yeshiva courtyards. In one case, a Sephardi couple opted to hold their wedding ceremony in an Osher Ad supermarket, which was exempt from the 10-person rule.[49]

After back and forth discussions with representatives of the chevra kadisha (religious burial society), the Health Ministry has allowed burial society members to proceed with many traditional aspects of burial for coronavirus victims. Burial workers will be garbed in full protective gear to perform the taharah (ritual purification) of the body, which will then be wrapped in the customary tachrichim (linen shrouds) followed by a layer of plastic. The funeral service must be held completely outdoors. Funeral attendees do not need to wear protective gear.[53]
On 19 March, Prime Minister Netanyahu declared a national state of emergency. He said that existing restrictions would henceforth be legally enforceable, and violators would be fined. Israelis were not allowed to leave their homes unless absolutely necessary. Essential services would remain open.[54] News reports showed hundreds of Israelis ignoring the new ban on Shabbat, 21 March, and visiting beaches, parks, and nature spots in large numbers, prompting the Ministry of Health to threaten imposing tighter restrictions on the public.[55][56] On 24 March, the government imposed tighter restrictions on citizens' movements to within 100 m (330 ft) of their homes, and enforced a stoppage of public transportation for one week's time.[57]
On 11 March, Israel delivered 20 tons of disinfectant to the West Bank.[58]
On 17 March, the Defense Ministry tightened restrictions on Palestinians workers, limiting entry to those working in essential sectors, and requiring that they remain in Israel instead of commuting.[59] Also, Israel and the Palestinian Authority set up a joint operations room to coordinate response to the virus.[60]

The virus may have been brought to the country by a merchant from Qom who had travelled to China.[5] Iran became a centre of the spread of the virus in the Middle East,[6][5] with more than ten countries tracing their cases back to Iran by 28 February.[5] Government's actions include cancellation of public events and Friday prayers, closure of schools, universities, shopping centres and bazaars as well as holy shrines, and banning of festival celebrations.[7][8] Economic measures were also announced to help families and businesses. The government has rejected plans to quarantine entire cities and areas, and heavy traffic between cities continued despite its intention to limit travel.[9][8]
Some non-Iranian-government sources estimates of the numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 deaths are much higher than official values.[10][11][12] The Iranian government has also been accused of coverups, censorship and mismanagement.[13][14][15][5] However, the World Health Organisation says that it has not seen problems with Iran's reported figures,[16] although later a WHO official indicated that only a fifth of the cases may be identified in Iran due to testing being limited only to severe cases initially, as was the situation with some European countries.[17] On 22 March 2020, Iran announced that 33 million Iranians had been tested for the virus.[18]

We mostly hear about Iranian officials being infected when their condition is already critical or after they have died. Before that the narrative is being completely controlled.""[207]

While the US sanctions legally allow humanitarian products to be sold to Iran, due to their nature, very few banks are willing to risk sanctions by trading with Iran.[209][210] This has severely limited the medical supplies available to the Iranian public health system in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. One right wing lobby group in the United States, United Against Nuclear Iran, has argued to stop all global humanitarian trade with Iran and prevent medical supplies from reaching the country.[211]

They concluded that Iran is likely to experience an ""epidemic of significant size"", while lack of identified cases in countries with close travel ties to Iran are because the cases are ""likely being missed, rather than being truly absent"".[220]
The government of Iran had insisted that there was no confirmed COVID-19 in Iran before 19 February 2020, when the first cases were announced.[221][222] However, a letter claimed to be[weasel words] from the Ministry of Health to the office of the President that circulated on social media[attribution needed] suggests that the Iranian authorities were aware of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths many days[weasel words] before the official announcement. Government officials said that the letter was a fake.[223][224] Another letter also circulated on social media;[attribution needed] it was signed by interior minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli and sent to Health Minister Saeed Namaki to request that the announcement of coronavirus outbreak be delayed[by whom?] until after the parliamentary election to avoid a low turnout of voters.[dubious  – discuss] The government has also denied this claim.[225]

On 2 March 2020, The World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom said in an interview with CNBC that the WHO has its own mechanism for checking national health authorities' statistics and did not see problems with the official Iranian government SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 counts.[228]
On 17 March 2020, WHO regional emergency director Rick Brennan said the number of cases reported in Iran could represent only about 20% of the real numbers because testing was restricted to severe cases, as is the case even in some wealthy European countries. He added ""We’ve said the weakest link in their chain is the data. They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up... [t]here’s a great commitment and they are taking it seriously from the highest level of government"".[17]
Masoud Pezeshkian, the First Deputy of the Parliament of Iran, claimed on 3 March 2020 that the figures reported by Iran's health ministry are ""not real"".[229]
Member of parliament for Qom Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani claimed on 24 February 2020 that COVID-19 had arrived in Qom three weeks prior, in early February, that the first death had occurred on 13 February but was not announced by officials, and that the true number of COVID-19 deaths in Qom was 50.[10][230] Deputy health minister Iraj Harirchi denied giving false figures, and stated that the death count was 12 with a total of 66 infections.[231]

The digging of the new section of burial pits began on 21 February, only two days after the government announced their first cases of COVID-19, and then rapidly expanded. The number of fresh graves suggests preparation for a far larger number of deaths.[234] Qom municipality official responsible for the city's burial sites said ""the graves had been planned before the outbreak as part of usual procedures in the cemetery"", and some observers pointed that overall length of the purported 100 yards of cannot accommodate more than about 75-100 graves.[235]

An ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first confirmed to have spread to Brazil on 25 February 2020, after a 61-year-old man from São Paulo who had returned from Lombardy, Italy tested positive for the virus. Since then, as of 22 March 2020, 1,546 cases were confirmed in the country — 459 of them in the state of São Paulo —, causing 25 deaths. Local transmission has been reported in at least seven states, and the pandemic has triggered a variety of responses from federal, state and local governments, while also impacting politics, education and the economy.
These are the deaths and new confirmed cases of the new Coronavirus in Brazil.

No further information was given about the patients in Porto Alegre and Curitiba. However, it was informed that the Belo Horizonte patient was a student that had recently visited Wuhan, China, point of origin of the outbreak.[10]
On 3 February, the Minister of Health Luiz Henrique Mandetta said that the Brazilian government would declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, even without confirmed cases in the country. He also said the government would assist on the return of Brazilians from Wuhan.[11] The following day, the Ministry confirmed that around 30 Brazilians were in Wuhan, and that they would return to the country on 8 February. It was also announced that they would be quarantined for 18 days in Anápolis, Goiás.[12]

Employees at four public hospitals in the city of São Paulo reported a shortage of materials such as alcohol gel, masks and gloves when caring for patients with suspected coronavirus (covid-19). Professionals report precariousness against coronavirus in the SUS: “The patient is exposed, and so are we”. With a shortage of masks and even rationing of gel alcohol, the situation of public service workers is different from that of private reference hospitals in São Paulo.[130][131]
Stores specializing in medical supplies no longer have alcohol gels and masks. Among them, those known as N95, used by health professionals. With the worldwide coronavirus pandemic and the great search for protection, street vendors (without sales in the middle of the pandemic crisis) have been taking advantage of the demand for equipment and trying to profit from it.[134]
On March 20, it was reported by the press that Brazil was contradicting the recommendation of the World Health Organization by only testing patients in severe condition. João Gabbardo, executive secretary at the Ministry of Health, said that the criteria adopted would not change, and people with serious cases will be tested for COVID-19.[74] The following day, a group of scientists announced they were developing new COVID-19 tests in Brazil. They expect to elaborate a test which will work with a single drop of blood from the patient. They expect it to be ready for the current outbreak of COVID-19, and hope to engage some of the main Brazilian universities in its development.[90]
Without protective items, health workers improvise caps like masks in hospitals. In addition to the first cases of coronavirus in Acre, health professionals in the state have to deal with the lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Some agents are improvising caps like masks.[137]

Dom Odilo Scherer, Archbishop of São Paulo has defended that churches should not be closed. He argues that there should be more daily services to diffuse large gatherings.[139] Bishop Edir Macedo, founder of the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God has also defended that services should not be suspended, as well as Silas Malafaia, leader of Assembleia de Deus Vitória em Cristo.[139] Malafaia said he would only close his churches if mandated by a court order. Macedo has caused greater controversy after he dismissed coronavirus as a creation of the media.

As of 29 February, there were seven confirmed cases. In March 2020, a cluster of cases were reported in numerous Croatian cities. On 12 March, the first recovery was reported.
The pandemic in Croatia occurred during the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.

On 22 March a large earthquake (5.4 on the Richter scale) hit the Croatian capital of Zagreb, causing problems in enforcement of social distancing measures set out by the Government. It was the strongest earthquake in Zagreb since the 1880 earthquake.
For the citizens, the Government set up a website koronavirus.hr for all information they are interested in, as well as a new phone line 113 that has volunteers answering their questions.[2]
Concerns over the virus began as soon as it began its rapid rise in China[3] and its effects on the international scale became clear. Concerns were raised about the increased probability of the virus entering Croatia because of the number of Chinese workers working on Pelješac Bridge. Some of the institutions in Croatia preemptively reacted to the potential threat.[3]
The airports in Croatia were prepared and they started going through passive measures and being vigilant.[3]
The Ministry of Health warned those travelling to China to avoid sick people, animals, and markets, not to eat any raw or semi-cooked animals, and to wash their hands often and to notify their doctor of their plans to travel to China.[citation needed]

Croatian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Zdravko Marić was asked to comment on to what extent the virus has affected the national economy, and if it could trigger an economic crisis. He said:
""It is very difficult to forecast what will happen, because the situation is changing on a daily basis. The situation is very serious, so I have to choose my words carefully. A lot of people are making off the cuff statements. No one in government is negating the problem, the problem is quite evident. But right now we cannot forecast the scope of its effect. No one can. Primarily because no one knows how long the coronavirus crisis will last.""[18]Minister Marić added that it was far too early to make any predictions regarding the national economy in 2020 and budgetary revenues:
""Right now I don't want to speculate on what its effects will be. Our budgetary projection for economic growth, GDP growth this year is 2.5%, it remains to be seen if we will have to adjust the figure down and if so by how much.""[18][18]The city of Dubrovnik began to brace for the economic impact that the coronavirus could cause in Croatia.[19]

On March 9 Governor Mike DeWine reported Ohio's first 3 cases in Cuyahoga County, a couple who had returned from a Nile River cruise, and a man who had returned from annual conference in Washington, DC where other cases of coronavirus had been reported.[4] Two days later, a fourth case, and the first instance of community spread, was confirmed by DeWine in Stark County.[5]
By March 13 there were a total of 13 cases, with 159 others under observation.[6][7] Within a week the first death was announced. Mark Wagoner, Sr, a prominent Toledo attorney and friend of DeWine, died March 19.[8]
By March 23 there were 442 COVID-19 cases, 6 of which resulted in death.[9]
By March 24 there were 564 confirmed cases in 49 of Ohio's 88 counties, with 145 of them resulting in hospitalization, and 8 resulting in death.[3]
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine was one of the first state governors to ""sound the alarm"" about the coronavirus threat, taking action before Ohio had many confirmed cases.[10] Axios called him ""among the leading governors in the country sounding the alarm about the threat of the coronavirus.""[10] The Washington Post called his and Acton's response ""a national guide to the crisis"", pointing out numerous occasions when moves taken by Ohio were soon followed by other states.[11] The Hill said he'd ""been one of the most aggressive governors in responding to the pandemic"".[12]
On March 3, when the state had no confirmed cases, DeWine cancelled the Arnold Classic, a move which the Washington Post said seemed radical at the time.[11] On March 5, when the state still had no confirmed cases, DeWine and Acton held a summit on COVID-19 preparedness for public health officials in the state.[13][14]
DeWine declared a state of emergency on March 9 while the state had only 3 cases.[15]
On March 12, The Ohio State University announced that all undergraduate students living in university housing would be required to return to their permanent home residences, or a non-campus or alternative housing arrangement and that the online class format would be extended to continue for the remainder of the spring semester.[16]  That same day DeWine announced that all schools from K-12 would close for a 3-week break, starting March 16;[17] he was the first governor to announce statewide school closings.[10] The Ohio Department of Education updated their guidelines for ensuring schoolchildren received meals, announcing that each district would make independent decisions about providing reduced and free breakfast and lunch to students during the break but encouraging districts to ensure needs were met and stating the department would continue to reimburse districts for meals served during the closure.[18]
Also on March 12 Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton instituted a ban on gatherings of more than 100, with exemptions for airports, workplaces, restaurants, religious gatherings, weddings and funerals.[19] Despite having only thirteen confirmed cases at the time, Ohio officials were predicting that there were over 100,000 cases in the state.[20] Department of Health director Acton compared the small number of cases to ""seeing a star and knowing that light is a moment from the deep past""[21] as she argued for Ohioans to take steps to prevent further infections that could overload the state's hospitals.[21] State Representative Emilia Sykes called Acton ""the real MVP of Ohio's coronavirus response.""[21]
DeWine and Acton on March 14 recommended Ohioans postpone elective surgeries.[22]
DeWine and Acton ordered the closure of all bars and restaurants starting 9:00 PM EDT March 15, 2020, saying the government ""encouraged restaurants to offer carryout or delivery service, but he said they would not be allowed to have people congregating in the businesses.""[23][19] DeWine said he was ""concerned that with St. Patrick's Day coming up Tuesday, people would ignore warnings and go out to bars.""[24] Closing of the state's estimated 22,000 restaurants was expected to affect some 500,000 workers.[25] DeWine instituted a liquor buyback program[12] and expanded Ohio's unemployment insurance to cover laid-off restaurant workers. The state waived the qualifying waiting period as well as the requirement that individuals receiving jobless benefits must seek new employment. The action also was extended to workers who are under quarantine or those who work in health care.[26] DeWine announced his intention to close daycares and recommended parents remove their children from daycare if possible.[10]
DeWine said of the closings:[10]
Establishments can stay open for carry-out and delivery. What we can't have is people congregating and seated. Every day we delay, more people will die. If we do not act and get some distance between people, our health care system in Ohio will not hold up. The loss won't only be those impacted by COVID19, but the danger is also to everyone else who needs hospital care for other issues.""Acton stressed the importance of ""flattening the curve"", saying:[27]
When our hospital systems are overwhelmed, that means if you are having a birth that you are planning, if you are in a car accident and need your hospital, if you have a stroke or an MI, even if you never get coronavirus, people in this country can die from something other than coronavirus.On March 16 DeWine banned gatherings of more than 50 people and on March 17 he ordered that all elective surgeries be postponed;[28] controversially, the state government indicated that this included abortions.[29] On March 18, DeWine announced that 181 BMV locations will close until further notice. Five will stay open to process commercial driver license applications and renewal. DeWine asked the state legislature to pass a grace period for people whose licenses expired. Barbershops, salons, and tattoo parlors closed.[30] Businesses that do stay open will have to take every employee's temperature every day before they start work and send anyone with a temperature over 100.4F home; DeWine warned that if businesses did not comply  he would close all nonessential businesses.[31][32] Mayor Andrew Ginther declared a state of emergency in Columbus, Ohio.[33]
On March 19 Governor DeWine signed state active duty proclamation that will activate 300 personnel from the Ohio National Guard to help with humanitarian efforts.[34] On March 20 DeWine ordered senior citizens centers to close by March 23.[35][36] The next day he closed adult day services serving more than ten people at a time, saying he had delayed closing them until ensuring provision had been made to care for those served in them.[37]
On March 22, Acton issued a statewide stay-at-home order to take effect from midnight on March 23 to through April 6, requiring the closure of nonessential businesses.[2] DeWine ordered most childcare facilities to close beginning March 26. The State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy approved restrictions on the dispensing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.[2]
DeWine said that because of the economic fallout from the closures, the state would need to slow down the rate of spending...rather dramatically,"" announcing on March 23 a hiring freeze for the state, a freeze on new contract services, and a continuation of the freeze on state employee travel. He asked cabinet members to find budget cuts of 20%.[38] According to Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted, Ohio would at the request of the Trump administration desist from publicizing unemployment figures.[39]
Ohio's 2020 primary elections were scheduled to be held Tuesday, March 17. DeWine, Acton, and Secretary of State Frank LaRose held an afternoon press conference on Monday, March 16 to cover precautions being taken for the next day's primary election.[27] LaRose issued an order to county boards of election allowing curbside voting.[27]
DeWine recommended pushing the primaries into June[40] but did not think he had the authority to change the date.[41] DeWine and LaRose sought a court order to close down the elections, having former Ohio Department of Aging Director Judith Brachman file a suit in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas to delay the election, but Judge Richard A. Frye denied it, saying it would set a ""terrible precedent"" and would represent a judge rewriting election code hours before an election.[41]
Acton, who according to the Columbus Dispatch ""has enormous powers during a health emergency"", eventually announced at 10:08 pm that polls would be closed as a ""health emergency.""[41][42] DeWine announced that LaRose would ""seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.""[42]
A suit was filed in the Ohio Supreme Court to overturn Acton's action by Perrysburg attorney Andy Mayle on behalf of a candidate for a Wood County Common Pleas judgeship, Corey Spiewak.[43] The court ordered the state to respond to the suit by 1:30 am Tuesday, saying that ""Due to exigent circumstances, this matter will be decided on the complaint and answer. No requests or stipulations for extension of time shall be filed, and the clerk of the court shall refuse to file any requests or stipulations for extension of time.[44][44] Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost and Solicitor General Benjamin M. Flowers filed an answer on behalf of LaRose.[45] A decision denying the writ was issued by four justices.[46] The three who did not participate in the decision were Judith French and Sharon Kennedy, both of whom were running for re-election, and Pat DeWine, who is the governor's son.[44]
The closing of restaurants and bars affected 22,000 restaurants across the state and 500,000 workers.[74] On March 20 a group of Cincinnati restaurateurs called on the federal government to provide a $225 billion bailout to the US restaurant industry.[75]
Most of state's sports teams were affected. Several leagues began postponing or suspending their seasons starting 12 March. Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training on that date, and on March 16, they announced that the season will be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, affecting the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds.[76] Also on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, affecting the Cleveland Cavaliers.[77]  In the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an infinite amount of time, affecting the Columbus Blue Jackets.[78]

New York (state) ,"
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in New York is part of an ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. The first case of COVID-19 in New York was confirmed on March 1, 2020.[5] As of March 23, 2020[update], there have been 25,665 confirmed cases in New York state,[1][2] and of those, 157 people have died.[4][3] New York has the highest number of confirmed cases of any state in the United States, having over ten times as many cases as Washington, the state with the second highest number of confirmed cases. Over 50 percent of known national cases are in the state,[6] with about 30 percent of the total cases in the nation being in New York City.[7]
March 1 saw the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in New York, a 39-year-old woman health care worker who lived in Manhattan.[8] She had returned from Iran on February 25 and had no symptoms at the time. She went into home isolation with her husband.[9] On March 3, a second case was confirmed, a lawyer in his 50s who lives in New Rochelle, Westchester County, immediately north of New York City, and works in Midtown Manhattan.[10] He had traveled to Miami in February and regularly visited Israel, but had not visited areas known to have widespread transmission of the coronavirus. Two of his four children had recently returned from Israel. He was admitted to a hospital in Westchester on February 27 and diagnosed with pneumonia, and released from isolation after testing negative for the flu.[11][12] Instances of panic buying in New York were reported after this case was confirmed.[13]
On March 4, the number of cases in New York increased to 11 as nine people linked to the lawyer tested as positive, including his wife, a son, a daughter, a neighbor, and a friend and his family.[14] On March 05, Mayor DeBlasio says that coronavirus fears should not keep New Yorkers off the subway, riding from Fulton Street to High Street in a public press attempt to demonstrate the safety of the transportation method.[15] On March 6, eleven new cases were reported bringing the state caseload to 33.[16] All the new cases were tied to the first community transmission case, the lawyer.[17] At the end of the day, an additional 11 new cases were reported by the governor, bringing the total caseload to 44, with 8 of the new cases in Westchester County, and 3 in Nassau County on Long Island.[18]. Also on March 6, an article appeared in the New York Post stating that while Mayor DeBlasio assigned responsibility for the lack of N95 masks and other PPE supplies to the federal government, the city never ordered the supplies until that date.[19]
On March 7, Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York after 89 cases had been confirmed in the state, 70 of them in Westchester County, 12 in New York City and 7 elsewhere.[20] On March 8, the state reported 16 new confirmed cases and a total of 106 cases statewide.[21] New York City issued new commuter guidelines amid the current outbreak, asking sick individuals to stay off public transit, encouraging citizens to avoid densely packed buses, subways, or trains.[22]
On March 9, New York City mayor Bill De Blasio announced that there were 16 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City.[23]
On March 10, Governor Cuomo announced a containment zone in the city of New Rochelle from March 12 to March 25.[24]
On March 11, Cuomo announced that the City University of New York and State University of New York schools would be closed for the following week, from March 12 to March 19. These college systems would move most classes to an online-based system starting March 19 and continuing through the rest of the spring semester. Dormitories will remain open for students ""who cannot return home for hardship reasons.""[25]
On March 11, a man in Monroe County tested positive, making it the first county in Western New York to have a COVID-19 case.[26] Officials say he flew into JFK from Italy, traveled on a Greyhound bus from Manhattan to Rochester, and arrived locally the morning of March 10. The bus continued on to Buffalo and Toronto.[27] On March 12, the first two cases were confirmed in Albany County, leading Albany mayor Kathy Sheehan to suspend the annual St. Patrick's Day parade.[28] The same day, a staff member at Union College tested positive for coronavirus in Schenectady County, marking the county's first case.[29]
On March 13, Herkimer County saw its first confirmed case but declined to disclose the patient's location. The patient later was revealed to have been from the Mohawk/Ilion area, just south of Herkimer, the county seat.[30]
On March 14, the first two fatalities in the state occurred. An 82-year-old woman in Brooklyn with pre-existing emphysema died in the hospital.[31] A 65-year-old person with other significant health problems who had not previously been tested for COVID-19 died at their home in Suffern, Rockland County.[32] It was also announced that three people in Erie County tested positive for COVID-19.[33]

On March 24, Cuomo stated that ""The apex is higher than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought."" He warned there was not enough assistance from the federal government and that the state had 25,000 cases and at least 210 deaths.[40] 211 NYPD officers and civilian employees have tested positive for Covid-19. In total, 2,774 NYPD employees, 7.6% of the workforce, are sick.[41]
After trying to purchase 200,000 N95 masks on February 7, the Office of Emergency Management learned that vendors were out of stock. Emergency provisions of masks and hand sanitizers did not arrive until early March. According to The New York Post, one medical supply vendor with standing city contracts said that the initial requests for protective gear from the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) were bogged down by inefficient bureaucratic delays. One vendor said, ""We'd send them a list of products we can deliver within 24, 48 hours"", but on average it took 72 hours for the agency to place an order. He added ""the city just moves so slow"" when there was very high demand coming from hospitals and the private sector. According to the contractor, 8 out of 10 supply orders were not able to be filled because DCAS did not pay on time, which a spokeswoman for NYC denied. The office of the comptroller approved 12 contracts with a total value of $150 million before the mayor's office took over the process on March 16. Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that NYC may run out of supplies by April if the federal government doesn't send 3 million N95 masks, 50 million surgical masks, 15,000 ventilators and 45 million surgical gowns, gloves, and face shields.[42]
One EMS worker expressed frustration at being asked to wear the less effective surgical masks.[43] The police union filed a complaint on March 13 due to NYPD officers not being given masks and other protective gear. A spokeswoman called the Police Benevolent Association's complaint ""empty rhetoric"".[44]
On March 4th, authorities failed to realize the gravity of the situation in a press conference, thematically labeling the epidemic caused by the virus and the pandemic ""caused by fear"" and reassuring the public that the situation would be under control given the capabilities of New York's health care system.[45]
On March 7, a State of Emergency was declared by Governor Andrew Cuomo.[46] On March 8, the Governor called for private testing due to demand outpacing the ability to test. The Governor called on the CDC to approve private testing and also approve automated testing.[47] Responding to the rush on hand sanitizer buying in the state and reported price gouging, Cuomo revealed on March 9 that the state would begin producing its own hand sanitizers, manufactured by prisoners in the state's correctional system.[48]
A number of schools and school districts announced closings or schedule modifications by March 8 due to the impact of the virus.[49][47] Additionally, all school trips were cancelled for those in New York City.[47]
On March 12, Governor Cuomo announced restrictions on mass gatherings, directing events with more than 500 people to be cancelled or postponed and any gathering with less than 500 people in attendance to cut capacity by 50 percent. In addition, only medically necessary visits would be allowed at nursing homes.[50]
Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that all Broadway theatres have been ordered to shut down at 5 p.m. that day, and that public gatherings in congregate spaces with more than 500 people were prohibited beginning 5 p.m. the following day. Broadway theatres are scheduled to reopen on April 13. Until then, the legal capacity of any venue with a capacity of 500 people or less was also reduced by half to discourage large gatherings.[51]
As part of the announcement, Cuomo waived the requirement that schools be open for 180 days that year in order to be eligible for state aid. The next day, all public school districts in Dutchess, Orange, and Ulster counties in the Mid-Hudson Valley, which had reported their first cases earlier in the week, announced they would close for the next two weeks. The Warwick schools in Orange County added that they would remain closed through April 14, when their annual spring break would normally end.[52]
On March 13, all public schools in Herkimer County announced they, too, would close until April 14. The county B.O.C.E.S. program and all its participating school districts' superintendents met and unanimously voted for the decision less than a day after the first confirmed case had been announced in the county.[53][54] That day, pressure from the teachers union (reported as ""furious"" about the schools remaining opened) and some city council members, was mounting on the Mayor of New York City to close schools. DeBlasio stated that he will keep the schools open, citing the need for meal programs to continue and child care to continue, Los Angeles and Chicago has closed their schools at the end of the prior week.[55]
The state's Civil Service Department postponed exams scheduled for the weekend of March 14–15.[56]
On March 13, drive-through testing began in New Rochelle, Westchester County.[57]

On March 18, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that nearly 5,000 tests were administered on March 17 alone, raising the total number to 14,597 people tested. Cuomo suggested that this may in part have led to the jump in confirmed cases to 2,382 statewide,[63] including 1,871 cases in New York City.[64]
Also on March 18, the Department of Defense said the Navy's hospital ship USNS Comfort is being prepared for deployment in New York, ""to assist potentially overwhelmed communities with acute patient care"".[65]
On March 20, Governor Cuomo announced the statewide stay-at-home order with a mandate that all non-essential workers work from home.[66] On the same day, President Donald Trump declared that major emergency existed in the state of New York, and ordered that Federal assistance be rendered to assist state and local recovery efforts.[67]
On March 22, Trump announced that he had directed Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide four large federal medical stations with 1,000 beds for New York.[68]
On March 24, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, advised people who have left New York City to self-quarantine for 14 days.[69]

Updated 11:30 a.m., March 17, 2020
Self-quarantines for persons who test positive or are symptomatic are not enforced due to a lack of resources. Several NYC area nurses have expressed concerns that patients are not complying with self-quarantine guidelines due to financial necessity or fear of losing their jobs. A NY State Nurses Association board member has expressed concerns that low-income patients who share rooms with other individuals may not be able to effectively self-isolate at their residences.[116]

In late February, the Department of Health stated that Ireland was in the Containment Phase of its strategy against the virus, though media briefings with such figures as Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan and Director of the National Reference Laboratory at UCD Cillian de Gascun were underway.[14] Three days later, on 29 February, the first confirmed case was announced involving a male student from the east of the country, who had arrived there from Northern Italy.[15][16] Authorities shut a secondary school linked to the case, Scoil Chaitríona in Glasnevin, for two weeks as a precautionary measure.[15][17] The State did not name the school involved, but – shortly afterwards – the Irish Examiner's Political Editor, Daniel McConnell, tweeted a copy of the letter it had sent to parents informing them it would close.[18]
On 3 March, a second case was confirmed of a female in the east of the country who had been to Northern Italy.[19] She had had no contact with the first case.
On 4 March, four more cases were confirmed, two females and two males in the west of the country who travelled from Northern Italy, bringing the total to six.[20]
On 5 March, seven more cases were confirmed, bringing the total to 13.[21] Four of the cases were related to travel from Northern Italy—four males from the east of the country—one of these four cases was connected to Trinity College Dublin.[22] Two of the seven cases were associated with close contact with a confirmed case—two females in the west of the country. One of the seven cases was a male in the south of the country who had no history of travel abroad.[23]
On 6 March, it was reported that more than 60 staff at Cork University Hospital would have to self-isolate following a case of community transmission of COVID-19 at the hospital.[24] The same day brought confirmation of five more cases, bringing the total in the country at that time to 18.[25]

Cork University Hospital discharged a patient who had been admitted for coronavirus disease after they made a full recovery.[31]
On 12 March, 27 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total cases in the country to 70.[32] In response to the increase of cases, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities until 29 March.[7] The announcement, which came one day after the World Health Organization formally declared that the outbreak was pandemic, also marked Ireland's movement from the Containment Phase in its strategy to combat the spread of the virus (a strategy which the Department of the Taoiseach had reaffirmed just three days earlier) towards the Delay Phase.[33][34]
On 13 March, 20 new cases were confirmed, bringing the total cases in the country to 90.[35]
On 14 March, 39 new cases were confirmed and another death announced of a man in the East of the country with underlying medical conditions. This brings the total cases to 129 with 2 deaths in total.[36]

On 10 March – following the Italian government's decision to lockdown the country in a bid to decelerate the rapid spread of the virus – Ryanair announced it would suspend all flights to, from and within Italy until 8 April, while Aer Lingus did likewise – but with 3 April as its intended end date.[76]
Initially, pubs and bars – alongside restaurants and cinemas – were permitted to remain open if they respected the social distancing measures introduced on 12 March. However, difficulties in maintaining this became clear over the weekend before Saint Patrick's Day. On 14 March, Minster for Health Simon Harris announced on Twitter: ""Not far from here, nurses & doctors are working to prepare for the impact of a global pandemic. Everyone is working 24/7. This is an insult to their efforts"", alongside one video circulating of a in Temple Bar pub filled with people singing an extract from ""Sweet Caroline"", i.e. ""Hands, touching hands... Reaching out, touching me, touching you"".[77][78] Harris acted swiftly, and – by the following morning – the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the Licensed Vintners Association and the Irish government issued a joint call for all bars and pubs to close from midnight until – at minimum – 29 March. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, a qualified medical doctor, advised on Twitter: ""People who have been out this weekend should avoid physical contact with seniors or people with chronic diseases. You could make them very, very sick"". Varadkar also used Twitter to reiterate his stance against mass gatherings of more than 100 people and stated his intention to ""seek enforcement powers from Dáil/Seanad"" if necessary, so as to compel delinquent pubs and bars to shut. The decision did not affect restaurants and cinemas – provided they maintained social distancing – though the Chief Executive of the Restaurants Association of Ireland, Adrian Cummins, called for a shutdown of the country's restaurant industry.[79][80][81]
Pubs continued to open though. Niall Collins stated that pubs in Limerick were opening.[82]
Restaurants, however, decided to shut their doors. On 22 March, it was announced that all McDonald's outlets in Ireland and the United Kingdom would be closed from 7pm on 23 March.[83][84] The day after the McDonald's announcement, coffeehouse chain Costa Coffee and restaurant franchise Subway both announced they would shut their Irish outlets, as did doughnut company Krispy Kreme do regarding its one Irish outlet in Dublin. The Irish fast food restaurant chain Supermac's announced the same day as the Costa and Subway closures that it would shut all its restaurants by the evening of 26 March; it intended the delay to allow emergency services using its facilities time to plan where they would eat, but did say it would shut its seating areas that night.[85]
Major departments stores shut, including McElhinney's on Sunday 13 March,[86] while Brown Thomas and Arnotts closed on the evening of 18 March.[87] The clothing retailer Penneys (which trades abroad as Primark) followed suit the same evening.[88][89]
By mid-March, nearly 3% of the population – 140,000 people (including 70,000 restaurant staff, 50,000 pub and bar staff and about 20,000 créche and childcare workers) – had lost their jobs due to restrictions brought in to delay the virus's spread.[90]
On 16 March, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection Regina Doherty announced a Pandemic Unemployment Payment, available for six weeks.[91] On 19 March, Doherty announced that all welfare would be distributed each fortnight instead of the traditional weekly, so as to limit the amount of people gathering in post offices.[92]
On 18 March, banks – together with Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe – announced a range of measures, including providing working capital, payment breaks and deferred court proceedings.[93]

Also on 6 March, six hospitals in the province of Munster – University Hospital Limerick, University Maternity Hospital Limerick, Ennis Hospital, Nenagh Hospital, St John's Hospital and Croom Orthopaedic Hospital – announced visitors were banned and that they would be cancelling all elective surgeries and outpatient appointments (with exceptions in such cases as caesarean sections, chemotherapy and dialysis) for the following Monday and Tuesday. This announcement came after the attendance of a patient at University Hospital Limerick's emergency department two days earlier, who was later confirmed as Covid-19 positive, leading staff to self-isolate and the emergency department to be closed for three hours so that it could be deep cleaned.[100]
And again on 6 March – this time in Cork University Hospital, also in Munster – more than 60 members of staff self-isolated after a case of COVID-19 emerged there.[101]

The Monday night current affairs television series Claire Byrne Live on 9 March 2020 was filmed with a reduced studio audience as an effort at social distancing; seven days later, on 16 March 2020, there was no studio audience at all and presenter Claire Byrne conducted interviews with guests – such as Minister for Health Simon Harris – live from her garden shed, as she had been advised to self-isolate.[108] On 23 March, ahead of her second week broadcasting to the nation from her shed, Byrne confirmed she had tested positive for Covid-19; the result had come as a shock to her as she had not had a temperature and assumed she had caught the common cold – though, as the week went on, her symptoms worsened, she had some difficulty breathing and experienced tiredness.[109] Byrne's diagnosis had been hinted at two days earlier when a then unnamed RTÉ staff member was reported to be COVID-19 positive.[110]
On 15 March 2020, The Irish Times announced that its building on Tara Street in Dublin would close immediately as a staff member had just been confirmed to have tested COVID-19 positive, though the paper remained in print and its website continued to be updated.[111]
On Wednesday 18 March, Newstalk radio presenter and former medical doctor Ciara Kelly announced that she had tested COVID-19 positive, though she was no longer practising, had taken precautions and had not been abroad.[112] She had continued to present the Monday and Tuesday editions of her programme, Lunchtime Live, from the hot press (a type of Irish cupboard) in her home, and Mick Heaney of The Irish Times described her Wednesday programme as ""a compelling show, remarkably so considering it was hosted by an ill woman sitting in an airing cupboard"".[113]

On 8 February, a general election took place in Ireland, before the outbreak had been declared a pandemic or reached Europe. Talks on government formation began soon afterwards and continued as the first case was confirmed in Ireland. 
On 20 February, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar offered his resignation to President Michael D. Higgins at Áras an Uachtaráin, remaining, however, as Taoiseach in a caretaker capacity until the formation of a new government.[118] President of Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald was the first high-profile politician affected by the spread of COVID-19, with her party cancelling events and her family entering self-isolation for a period, after McDonald confirmed on 2 March that her children attended the same school as the student with the first recorded case of COVID-19 in Ireland.[119] While in Washington ahead of Saint Patrick's Day, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced measures intended to stop COVID-19 spreading, including the closure of all schools, universities and childcare facilities from the following day, as well as the closure of all cultural institutions and the cancellation of ""all indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor mass gatherings of more than 500 people"".[120]
On 16 March, Thomas Pringle, an independent TD representing the Donegal constituency, entered isolation due to previous contact with someone in Dublin and the high risk to his own personal health.[121][122] After returning home earlier than anticipated from his visit to the United States, the Taoiseach addressed the nation on Saint Patrick's Night during A Ministerial Broadcast by An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, TD, introducing television viewers to the concept of ""cocooning"", i.e. ""At a certain point… we will advise the elderly and people who have a long-term illness to stay at home for several weeks"".[123][124][125] The speech, which Varadkar made under Section 112 of the Broadcast Act, was the most watched television event in Irish history, surpassing the previous record held by The Late Late Toy Show by an additional total of about 25% and was widely distributed globally.[126][127] It was also plagiarised by Peter Bellew, the chief operating officer at British low-cost airline group EasyJet.[128]

At the written request of Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the sitting was limited to 48 TDs (11 each representing Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, four Greens, three members of the Regional Group and two members of all other parties and groups). The legislation – Health (Preservation and Protection and other Emergency Measures in the Public Interest) Bill 2020 – passed all stages, and, following requests by opposition TDs, included a sunset provision for review in November.[130] During the sitting, Eamon Ryan called on the Irish to grow lettuce on their window sills: ""Let's get every south facing window sill in this country and lets plant our seeds in the next week so that if there is any supply crisis in food in two or three months time when this really hits hard, we'll have our salads ready to go"".[131]
On 19 March, it was reported that Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government Eoghan Murphy had been in self-isolation for the past week after returning from a visit abroad to see family. Murphy had set off before travel advice against doing so was issued and – while he had ""not been in direct physical contact with any colleagues"" – he, nevertheless, was well enough to continue his work remotely.[132]
On 20 March, Seanad Éireann – also sitting in reduced numbers – passed the legislation after a three-hour debate.[133] President Higgins wrote the legislation into law later that day, giving the state the power to detain people, restrict travel and keep people in their homes in order to restrict the pandemic.[9]
On 23 March, Tánaiste (i.e. deputy head of government) Simon Coveney revealed he had tested negative for COVID-19. He underwent the test after being contact traced via the positive result of Claire Byrne, whom he had sat beside on live television less than two weeks previously.[134] It was believed that Coveney was the first member of the Varadkar cabinet to be tested for the virus.[135]
Countless sporting events were affected by the arrival of the virus. Following the Taoiseach's 12 March announcement from Washington, the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA), Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) and Football Association of Ireland (FAI) all immediately announced the two-week suspension of games.[136]
On 12 March, the 2019–20 Pro14 was suspended indefinitely.[137] Ireland's final two Six Nations rugby fixtures against Italy and France were postponed.[138][139] The IRFU postponed the Italy game, scheduled for 7 March, on 26 February. after it met with Minister for Health Simon Harris for an hour at the Department of Health.[140] However, thousands of Italian fans were permitted to fly into Dublin anyway on the weekend of the game from the epicentre of the outbreak in Europe, and were not even checked at Dublin Airport for symptoms of the disease.[141][142][143]
On 20 March, the IRFU announced pay deferrals of between 10% and 50% for staff, including each of its professional players.[144]
On 13 March, Minister for Health Simon Harris said people returning from Spain or Italy would have to ""not quite self-isolate"" but ""restrict their movements"" upon returning to Ireland; this affected Tipperary, the reigning All-Ireland Hurling Champions, who had flown in advance to the Costa Blanca in Spain for a training camp.[145][146] On 15 March, footballer Dr Jack McCaffrey issued a video message thanking the public for their co-operation, which was relayed by Dublin GAA and media outlets – McCaffrey noting that he had shaven his beard to protect his patients.[147] On 17 March, the GAA confirmed that the opening fixture of the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, due to have taken place at Gaelic Park in The Bronx on 3 May, had been postponed.[148] Also that day, Michael Carton, the former Dublin hurler who won the 2013 Leinster Senior Hurling Championship, revealed he had been in hospital since the previous weekend after testing positive for COVID-19.[149] On 18 March, the GAA confirmed that its Féile na Gael 2020 hurling and camogie event (jointly to have been hosted by Dublin, Kildare and Meath in early June), Féile na nÓg National football tournaments (jointly to have been hosted by Donegal, Derry, and Tyrone in late June), the Celtic Challenge under-17 hurling development competition and every event intended to have involved academy squads, would be cancelled in 2020 as a result of the damage done by the virus to its other competitions.[150]
On 10 March, Slovakia suspended all sports events for two weeks, 17 days before the Republic of Ireland were due to play the country's football team in Bratislava in their UEFA Euro 2020 play-off.[151] However, on 17 March, the entire tournament – among which were four games scheduled for Ireland – was postponed until 2021 to allow time for the enormous backlog of club fixtures caused by the virus across the continent to be played.[152][153] On the night of 15 March, League of Ireland club Drogheda United sent a letter to all its staff and players informing them it would cease paying them.[154] On 19 March, Sligo Rovers announced it would temporarily make all its staff and players redundant, having already assisted those from abroad in returning home.[155] On 21 March, Cork City announced it would stop paying its players and staff.[156][157]

The Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference issued a statement on 12 March, following the Taoiseach's Washington announcement on limitations to public gatherings. Among the pastoral directions given were reductions in the amount of people attending congregations to the less than 100 that Varadkar had advised. Thus, Irish Catholics were permitted to forgo the obligation ""to physically attend Sunday Mass"", particularly if they were elderly or had underlying health conditions known to be worsened by infection with the virus. Bishops advised that members of the congregation should be informed of how they might ""participate in Mass via local radio and online"".[162] Holy water fonts would be emptied; hand sanitiser made available at each entrance of the church; the sign of peace expressed preferably through other means than the tradition of hand shaking; the Eucharist to be taken in the hand and not the mouth; only one person to drink from the chalice; priests to avail of cotton buds or surgical gloves while engaged in the anointing of the sick; priests to make the sign of the cross over the baby during baptism without touching the child's head; no shaking the hands of the bereaved during funerals.[163]

In the wake of fake news and rumours circulating online – including claims that a military-enforced ""status red lockdown"" would be enforced from 11:00 on Monday 16 March – ministers and the head of the Defence Forces made calls for people to be more responsible with the information they shared online and to only trust reputable sources.[176][177]

Greece ,"
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic first appeared in Greece on 26 February 2020. Initial cases related to people who had travelled to Italy, as well as a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt and their contacts.
As of 24 March 2020[update], there have been 743 confirmed cases, 32 recoveries and 20 deaths.[2] Health authorities recommend travelers who have returned from affected areas or people who have been in contact with them to stay home for a minimum of 14 days. It may take 2–14 days for symptoms to appear after initial exposure to the virus. Thirteen reporting hospitals have been designated to deal with cases. The main affected areas are Elis and Attica.
Following the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly Ilia, Achaea and Zakynthos). However, on March 10, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.
On 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel. The Hellenic Police, the Municipal Police, the Hellenic Coast Guard and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.

The Greek Government has announced the following measures:[21]
On 9 March, all school trips were banned, all sports games were to be played with no fans attending and all school championships were cancelled,[84] and starting on 10 March, all educational institutions were closed for 14 days.[85] On 14 March, all air traffic with Italy was banned.[86]
On 16 March Greece closed its borders with Albania and North Macedonia, deciding to suspend all road, sea and air links with these countries, while only permitting the transportation of goods and the entry of Greek nationals and residents. The suspension of ferry services to and from Italy, air links to Spain, as well as the prohibition of all cruise ships and sailboats docking in Greek ports was also decided.[87] On the same day, two villages in Western Macedonia, Damaskinia and Dragasia, were quarantined after several cases among their residents were confirmed. The entry and exit to and from the villages was banned, allowing only medical staff and municipal staff to supply them with medication and food.[88] On 18 March, Greece announced new coronavirus restrictions pertaining to migrant camps. For thirty days, the movement of camp residents would be restricted to small groups between 7am and 7pm, which could only include one person per family and would be controlled by police on public transport. Specialised medical teams were sent to the camps for the creation of virus isolation areas and compulsory temperature checking. All other visits to the camps whether by individuals or organisations were suspended for at least 14 days.[89] On the same day, Deputy Minister of Civil Protection and Crisis Management Nikos Hardalias announced a ban on public gatherings of 10 or more people and the imposition of a 1,000 euro fine on violators.[90][91]
On 20 March, Minister of Maritime Affairs and Insular Policy Giannis Plakiotakis announced that only permanent residents and supply trucks would be allowed to travel to the Greek islands, with effect from 6am local time on 21 March. Travellers will need to provide proof of permanent residence (via a tax certificate) on the island to which they wish to travel. People who are already on the islands and wish to leave are allowed to return to the mainland.[92][93]
On 22 March, the Greek government announced a ban on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March until 6 April. Movement is permitted only for a prescribed set of reasons that include moving to or from the workplace during normal business hours, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help, exercising out individually or in pairs or walking a pet, attending a ceremony (wedding, baptism, funeral etc.), and cases of divorced parents moving to ensure communication with their children. People returning to their permanent places of residence will also be exempt. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their ID or passport with them, as well as some type of certification explaining the reason for their movement which has to be confirmed by their employer or by themselves. The options include filling in a special form that can be downloaded from the government website forma.gov.gr, sending a free SMS to the number 13033, or explaining their reason in a signed handwritten declaration. The information needed include the name, home address, time of departure from home, and the specific reason for transport that falls under one of the exceptions.

Chan School of Public Health, ""analysed air traffic out of the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak in China and suggested in a report ... that Indonesia might have missed cases"" of coronavirus disease 2019.[251][252][253] Western diplomats[254][255][256] as well as local[250][257] and international[258][259][260] news outlets postulated that the lack of cases within Indonesia result from inadequate testing and under reporting, as opposed to sheer luck and divine intervention.[261][262]
The government faced backlash after instead pledging to set aside IDR 72 billion ($5m) to pay for social media influencers to attract tourists to Indonesia.[263]
Indonesian president Joko Widodo is also criticised by Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry,[264] human rights groups,[265] and also by political party such as Golkar and PKS[266][267] for lack of transparency regarding the information of the COVID-19. Widodo have insisted not to share the travel history details of the patients that tested positive with coronavirus in an attempt to reduce panic and uneasiness in the general public.[268] The public had asked the government to release official national map of COVID-19 confirmed cases' location, as unofficial independent maps may provide incorrect data.[269]

Numbers of shopping malls started to halt some of their tenant's operation; only pharmacies, groceries and ATM still operate.[284]
Indonesian tourism is also suffering the effect, with Bali suffering a 33% drop in tourism arrivals when compared to January, and a steep 96% reduction of Chinese travellers. Hotels are taking on an exceptionally low occupancy rate, with some hotels experiencing 5% and even 0% occupancy rate due to overspecialisation on Chinese visitors, increasing travel restrictions from source countries, and an overall fear of the virus.[285] There is however an increase in interest for domestic tourism,[286] and Chinese tourists already on the island have generally opted to extend their stay.[287]
Jakarta ePrix race of the 2019–20 Formula E season will also be postponed due to coronavirus concerns.[288] The city's Capital Investment and One-Stop Service (PM-PTSP) announced it plans to postpone any public events with mass-gatherings from March to April following the news of increasing number of COVID-19 cases to 27.[289]

In the middle of March, the country could test about 1,000 samples per day, which is less than the capabilities of other European countries. Therefore, certain groups were prioritised in testing, such as healthcare workers, elderly, and people with acute symptoms.[112] This also explains a relatively large ratio of the number of deaths to the number of confirmed cases.[113]

After this first case of community transmission in the U.S., a case with no known origin, was recognized in Solano County, California,[60] the CDC has revised its criteria for testing patients for coronavirus and on February 28 has begun sending out the new guidelines for healthcare workers. CDC director Dr. Redfield said the new health recommendation should be when a clinician or individual suspects coronavirus, then we should be able to get a test for coronavirus.[61][62]
On March 1, two cases were reported in Alameda and Solano Counties, in health care workers at the NorthBay VacaValley Hospital. The workers were exposed to the patient in the case reported February 26 in Solano County.[63] In Santa Clara County, three more cases were reported, bringing the total number of cases in the county to seven.

This marked the eleventh death in the United States attributable to coronavirus, the first death in the U.S. attributable to coronavirus outside Washington state, and the first death in California attributable to coronavirus.[77][78] The source of the new case's infection appears to be the same as that of a resident of Sonoma County who tested positive on March 2 and who was also aboard the cruise ship Grand Princess on the same dates.[79][80] In relation to this, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a State of Emergency in California.[81] Consequently, Princess Cruises, the owner and operator of the cruise ship Grand Princess, working with the CDC, the state of California, and public health officials in San Francisco, terminated a port call in Ensenada, Mexico planned for March 5 and ordered the cruise ship to return to San Francisco over concerns about the potential for an outbreak of coronavirus aboard the cruise ship.

Many doctors and nurses and EMS workers expressed fears and frustrations at being asked to wear the less effective surgical masks and at the overall lack of proper masks, gowns and eye gear which imperils their ability to fight the coronavirus and puts their own lives at risk.[196][197] 
The medical workers are concerned that the shortages have not been addressed by the CDC, whose changing guidance for healthcare over how to stay safe themselves and protect the patients remained unclear and misleading, and that the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science.[196]
Mid-March, the CDC changed its guidance from stating earlier that regular surgical masks cannot protect a healthy person from infection to now saying that regular masks are ""an acceptable alternative"" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the N95 respirators. The American Nurses Association sent a letter to Congress, saying there is concern 
""that C.D.C. recommendations are based solely on supply chain and manufacturing challenges,"" and ""that these recommendations do not offer strategies to address the limited manufacturing and supply chain of necessary personal protective equipment.""[196]
There were calls for crowdsourcing on social media, to donate any masks, goggles or other equipment to healthcare professionals.[198]

On February 27, California Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state was limited in testing for the new coronavirus because it had only 200 testing kits.[207]
On March 3, Placer County declared a public health emergency, following the confirmation of a second coronavirus case in that county.[208] On March 4, Governor Newsom declared a state of emergency after the first death in California attributable to coronavirus occurred in Placer County.[209][210][211]

On March 19, Sacramento County upgraded its stay-at-home directive into an official order that carries legal consequences.[241] Governor Newsom then announced a statewide stay-at-home order.[242][243][244] 
Governor Newsom said that the state has asked the Department of Defense to deploy the Navy's USNS Mercy hospital ship in California.[245]

Thailand ,"
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Thailand on 13 January 2020. Thailand was the first country to confirm a case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outside of China.
A 61-year-old Chinese woman who is a resident of Wuhan had not visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, but was noted to have been to other markets. She developed a sore throat, fever, chills and a headache on 5 January, flew directly with family and a tour group from Wuhan to Suvarnabhumi Airport on 8 January, where she was detected using thermal surveillance and then hospitalised. Four days later she tested positive.[1][2][3]
Thailand's second comfirmed case occurred in a 74-year-old woman who arrived in Bangkok on a flight from Wuhan on 17 January.[4] On 21 January, Nakornping Hospital reported a suspected case of a 18-year-old male patient who arrived in Chiang Mai from Wuhan with a high fever; his blood samples were sent to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital in Bangkok for further analysis.[5][6] His condition had improved according to an official statement released by Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital on 31 January.[7]
On 22 January, the MOPH announced two additional confirmed cases. The third was a 68-year-old man, a Chinese tourist as in previous cases. The fourth case was the first case for a Thai citizen; a 73-year-old woman hospitalised at Nakhon Pathom Hospital [th] in Nakhon Pathom Province, arriving from Wuhan.[8][9]
The fifth case was confirmed on 24 January involving a 33-year-old Chinese woman arriving from Wuhan with her 7-year-old daughter who was not infected. She admitted herself to Rajvithi Hospital, three days after her arrival in Bangkok on 21 January.[10]
On 26 January, the MOPH said eight cases were confirmed, including one from Hua Hin. All were Chinese, except for a woman from Nakhon Pathom. The first five patients were discharged.[11]
Another six cases were confirmed on 28 January, with five from the same family in Wuhan and another from Chongqing. Thailand began scanning all travellers from China.[12][13]
On 31 January, an additional five cases were reported, bringing the cumulative number of confirmed cases to 19. One was a local taxi driver who had no records of travelling to China and was thus suspected to have been infected by a Chinese tourist he picked up, making this the first case of human-to-human virus transmission within the country. The taxi driver was reported to have come into contact with at least thirteen other individuals, mostly family members, before seeking treatment.[14]
On 2 February, doctors from the Rajavithi Hospital announced that they had seen success in treating severe cases of COVID-19 using a combination of drugs for flu (oseltamivir) and HIV (lopinavir and ritonavir), with initial results showing improvement 48 hours after applying the treatment.  However, it was too soon to confirm that this approach can be applied to all cases.[15]
On 4 February, the government dispatched a Thai AirAsia plane to retrieve 138 citizens who were trapped in Wuhan following the lockdown, which landed at U-Tapao International Airport at 7:00 p.m. local time. Among the evacuees, six were hospitalised with high temperatures, with the rest subsequently sent to be quarantined in Sattahip Naval Base for two weeks. Three citizens were not evacuated, which included two students with high fever and another with an overstayed visa.[16] On the same day, Thailand confirmed another six cases, including a Thai couple who had just returned from Japan; it was unclear whether they had contracted the virus while travelling or after returning to Thailand. Two new cases were also reported in drivers who had picked up Chinese passengers.[17]
On 8 February, another six cases were confirmed involving two Chinese, and one passenger on board the evacuation flight from 4 days ago and two other Thais who had exposure to tourists. These six cases brought the total count of confirmed cases to 32.[18]
On 15 February, the 35th case was found in a 35-year-old Thai woman who worked in a private hospital, marking the first infection in a health worker. An investigation found that she did not wear a mask and protective suit while treating a patient.[19] Several previous reports erroneously claimed that she worked for Bamrasnaradura Institute, which was later refuted and clarified by the MOPH.[20]
After 8 days with no reported cases, two more cases were confirmed on 24 February, bringing the number to 37.[21] Two days later, the number of confirmed cases went up to 40, two of which were Thai nationals who had recently been to Japan. The elderly couple, who had just returned from Hokkaido, had already spread their virus to their grandson at home before seeking treatment. 101 individuals whom they came into contact with were tested for the virus.[22] The grandfather was criticised by Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul for initially refusing to disclose his travel history when interrogated by doctors, as he was at risk of becoming a super-spreader.[23]
On 1 March, the MOPH reported the first confirmed death in Thailand, a 35-year-old Thai who was originally diagnosed with dengue fever. He initially made a full recovery before dying from multiple organ failure due to lung damage caused by the virus. The ministry is carrying out investigations to find out which disease is the main cause of his death.[24][needs update] On the same day, King Power issued a statement identifying the man who had died as one of the company's partner-product consultants at their Sivaree branch store. The branch has been closed since the day he tested positive for the virus and all staff examined by health officials.[25]
On March 22, Thailand reported 188 new cases.[26] On March 24, three new deaths were announced, all of whom were Thai nationals, including a 79-year-old male linked to the Lumpinee Boxing Stadium cluster.[27] 4 medical workers were also announced to have been infected with the virus after coming in contact with patients who refused to reveal their travel history while seeking treatment.[28]

Africa ,"
Lockdowns
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Africa on 14 February 2020. The first confirmed case on the continent was in Egypt,[2][3] and the first confirmed case in sub-Saharan Africa was in Nigeria.[4] As of mid-March, the number of reported cases in Africa is relatively low. It is unclear whether this is because the disease is spreading undetected or because it is not spreading much (perhaps because of higher temperatures or limited international travel connections).[5][6] Most of the identified cases have arrived from Europe and the United States rather than from China.[5]
Experts have worried about COVID-19 spreading to Africa, because many of the healthcare systems on the continent are inadequate, having problems such as lack of equipment, lack of funding, insufficient training of healthcare workers, and inefficient data transmission. It was feared that the pandemic could be difficult to keep under control in Africa, and could cause huge economic problems if it spread widely.[6][5]
Matshidiso Moeti of the World Health Organization said that hand washing and physical distancing could be challenging in some places in Africa. Lockdowns may not be possible, and challenges may be exacerbated by the prevalence of diseases such as malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, and cholera.[6]
The World Health Organization helped many countries on the continent set up laboratories for COVID-19 testing.[6]
Many preventive measures have been implemented in different countries in Africa, including travel restrictions, flight cancellations, event cancellations,[7] school closures, and border closures.[8] Experts say that experience battling Ebola helped some countries prepare for COVID-19.[6][7]
Currently, as of 24 March 2020, the following ten African countries have yet to report a case of COVID-19: Botswana, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan.

Michigan ,"The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Michigan is part of the ongoing global viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which first appeared in the U.S. state of Michigan on March 10. As of March 24, at least 1,791 cases and 24 deaths have been confirmed.[1][2] Currently, 36 of Michigan's 83 counties have been impacted, located within both the Lower and Upper peninsulas. A majority of the cases are in Metro Detroit, specifically Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties, which all have over 200 cases each.[1]
The national coronavirus outbreak triggered a state of emergency response at the state level on March 10, followed by Governor Gretchen Whitmer announcing the closure of all K–12 school buildings until April 5.[3][4] On March 16, Governor Whitmer ordered bars, restaurants, entertainment venues, and other businesses to partially close for two weeks and later banned events and gatherings of more than 50 from March 17–April 5.[5][6] She has also issued a pair of executive orders to prevent price gouging, one to halt tenant evictions, one to help curb the spread of the virus in medical facilities throughout the state, as well as one closing ""non-essential personal care service"" facilities such as nail and hair salons.[7][8][9][10][11] On March 24, a statewide stay-at-home order was issued, limiting all non-essential travel and discontinuing all non-essential business services and operations.[12]
Additionally, major colleges and universities within the state switched instruction to alternate remote learning formats and canceled large social events and gatherings.[13][14] The outbreak also caused many corporations and businesses to alter capacity and operations in order to adapt to the progression of cases, and many major collegiate and professional sports seasons were postponed or canceled.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21]
The state legislature approved $125 million to aid in relief efforts, and Governor Whitmer called in the Michigan Army National Guard to assist with supply distribution,[22][23] which subsequently fueled rumors of a potential shift to martial law within the state. Whitmer later dismissed this as false.[24]
Notable transmission clusters have been identified at singer Sandi Patty's March 8 concert at Andrews University in Berrien Springs, which has so far been linked to three subsequent cases in Berrien County, and within the Detroit Police Department, where eight members have tested positive for the virus, one has died, and a further 233 have been placed under quarantine.[25][26][27][28]
The state's first two confirmed cases were reported on March 10, one each in Wayne and Oakland counties.[4] On March 11, the University of Michigan announced classes would be moving online for the rest of the year and large gatherings would be canceled.[29] Central Michigan University, Eastern Michigan University, Grand Valley State University, Lawrence Technological University, Macomb Community College, Michigan State University, Michigan Technological University, Oakland University, and Wayne State University also announced various extensions, postponements, and alterations to academic schedules and formats.[13]
On March 12, ten new presumptive-positive cases were announced, bringing the state's total to twelve cases.[30] Carman-Ainsworth Community Schools identified a middle-schooler in the district who had been exposed on March 7 to a case who tested positive on March 11. The student attended school in the district through March 11.[31] In response to the increase in cases, Whitmer announced the statewide closure of all K-12 school buildings, effective March 16 and extending through April 5.[32]

Later in the day, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services officials disclosed knowledge of 30 more cases, whose locations were undisclosed at the time. Later on March 18, the state's total was estimated at 110 per several news sources, with one source reporting as many as 116.[38][39][40][41][42][37]
Two more deaths reportedly occurred on March 18: an 81-year old in Detroit and a woman in her 50s with underlying health conditions in Pontiac.[43]
The official count was updated to 336 positive cases on March 19, which included private tests from the previous two weeks that had not been included in prior totals. One case each in Isabella and Genesee counties were later removed from the government tally due to errors in reporting, decreasing the total to 334.[1][44] 215 cases were confirmed on March 20, and 10 more were re-classified, for a state-wide total of 549. Additional cases in Ottawa and Barry counties were confirmed at the county-level. Genesee County also confirmed their first four positive cases, one of which was included in the earlier state total.[45] A fourth death, a man in Oakland County in his 50s with underlying health conditions, was reported on March 20.[46] The number of cases rose to 787 on March 21, with a fifth death reported, a person in Detroit.[47] Three more deaths were reported later that day, one each in Macomb, Oakland, and Kent counties, for a total of eight.[48]

As of March 24, eight Detroit Police Department employees have tested positive for COVID-19, while 233 others have been placed in quarantine.[25][28] On March 24, one death was reported within the department, a 38-year-old civilian dispatcher.[28]
On February 3, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services activated its Community Health Emergency Coordination Center to manage the state government's response to coronavirus.[51]  On February 28, the State Emergency Operations Center was activated by Governor Gretchen Whitmer to assist with coordination.[52]  On March 3, the Governor created four COVID-19 Task Forces: State Operations, Health and Human Services, Education, and Economy/Workforce.[53] As of March 11, all campuses of the University of Michigan, Western Michigan University, Wayne State University, Michigan Technological University, Northern Michigan University, Michigan State University, Grand Valley State University, and Central Michigan University had various restrictions on students and faculty in response to the virus.[14][54][55]
On March 12, Governor Whitmer issued an order to have all K-12 schools closed beginning Monday, March 16.[3]  On March 13, Whitmer signed Executive Order 2020-05 which banned all gatherings of more than 250 people in addition to the closure of schools.[56]  The ban made exceptions for residential facilities and child care services at schools in addition to exemptions for consumers buying groceries or products, for industrial and manufacturing work, and for public transport and other forms of mass transit.[57] The ban was lowered to 50 people on March 16 per a CDC recommendation and is effective from March 17–April 5.[5] The order was later updated to exclude houses of worship from penalty if they convened more than 50 people.[58]
Additionally on March 13, the Michigan Department of Education was granted a federal waiver by the United States Department of Agriculture. The waiver allowed for students who will receive food from the Unanticipated School Closure SFSP to not be mandated to receive the food in a group setting.[59]  The Michigan Department of Corrections banned visitors to prisons, along with prohibiting any volunteers from the prison. Staff at prisons will be required to have their temperature tested and be proven to be under 100.4 °F (38.0 °C) along with other measures.[60]  The Michigan Career and Technical Institute suspended all programs until April 5.[61]
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson issued an order starting March 16 to limit all Michigan Secretary of State branch offices to appointment-only instead of walk-ins.  The only services provided by the offices will be for those applying for new licenses and IDs, for title transfers, and for testing for a license.  All branches will no longer be open on Saturdays, with most weekday hours expanding.  For those renewing their licenses, the proof of car insurance requirement was waived.  Also waived were late fees associated with the change.[62]
On March 10, Attorney General Dana Nessel set up a hotline to report businesses price gouging goods such as toilet paper, meat, milk, bread, bottled water, face masks, hand sanitizers, and cleaning supplies. Sellers face fines if their asking price is at least 20% higher than it was on March 9, after an executive order from Governor Whitmer banned the practice, until April 16. The order includes a clause that exempts retailers if they ""can prove the increase is attributable to an increase in cost of bringing the product to market or an extraordinary discount was in effect as of March 9"".[9] As of March 19, at least 800 complaints have been received.[63] On March 19, Nessel sent a cease and desist letter to Menards after her investigators found evidence of price hikes, sometimes doubling the retail cost, on high-demand bleach and 3M face masks. In other instances, tipsters reported seeing face masks that cost $10 each, cases of water for $35, and bottles of hand sanitizer for $60. Whitmer issued a second order on March 20 which ""focuses enforcement resources on the cases most pertinent to the emergency by clarifying which price increases constitute price gouging.""[10]
On March 17, the Michigan Legislature approved $125 million to fight the pandemic, with $50 million going towards the Department of Health and Human Services and another $40 million towards other state agencies for ongoing coronavirus response needs. Another $35 million was set in reserve in case more funding becomes necessary in the future.[22] On March 18, Governor Whitmer asked the Michigan Army National Guard to ""assist the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services with assembling and loading critical personal protective gear, such as gloves, gowns, and face shields.""[23] In response to widespread rumors that were circulating regarding the National Guard's presence in the state, Whitmer reaffirmed on March 20 that there were no active plans to implement martial law, although she did indicate that state officials were monitoring the effectiveness of lock-down protocols in other states, should they become necessary.[24]
On March 20, Governor Whitmer signed an executive order banning landlords from filing eviction requests against tenants until April 17, which she says ""relieves courts from certain statutory restrictions to enable them to stay eviction-related proceedings until after the COVID-19 emergency has passed"".[7] Also on that date, Whitmer signed an executive order for medical and dental facilities to postpone any ""non-essential"" procedures, such as plastic surgery and teeth whitening, beginning March 20 through the time the State of Emergency is lifted.[8] On March 21, Whitmer issued an executive order to close facilities that provide non-essential personal care services such as hair and nail salons, tanning salons, spas, and businesses that offer massages, tattoos, body art, and piercings, until April 13.[11]
On March 22, Flint mayor Sheldon Neeley issued a shelter-in-place advisory for the city's citizens, after having previously declared a state of emergency for the city on March 12.[64] On March 23, Governor Whitmer issued a statewide stay-at-home order, starting the morning of Tuesday, March 24, and lasting for at least three weeks.[12] ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"", Executive Order 2020-21 directed all businesses and operations to temporarily suspend in-person services that are not necessary to sustain or protect life. The order directed residents to remain ""in their homes unless they’re a part of an essential workforce, engaged in an outdoor activity, or performing tasks necessary to the health and safety of themselves or their family, like going to the hospital or grocery store."" When leaving the house, individuals must adhere to social distancing measures, as directed by the CDC.[12]
During the week of March 16, Michigan Medicine started in-house testing for COVID-19, with the capabilities to deliver same-day results. This allowed the hospital to bypass the state's testing system, which was previously the sole provider of testing for the virus. The same week, the health system also launched drive-thru testing services for Michigan Medicine patients at West Ann Arbor Health Center, Brighton Health Center, and Canton Health Center.[65] Similarly, Beaumont Health and Henry Ford Health System in Metro Detroit have also developed in-house testing methods in an effort to increase overall testing capacity within the state.[65] The state restructured reporting procedures and began incorporating private test results in official government case tallies on March 19.[44]
On March 13, Delta Air Lines, which has a major hub at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said it will cancel all flights to Europe for the next 30 days, decreasing flight amounts by 40% and grounding 300 planes.[19] Delta had previously indicated it would reduce international flights by 20–25% and domestic flights by 10–15%.[66] Starting on March 15, several grocery chains that have stores in Michigan, including Kroger, Meijer, and Walmart, began reducing their business hours for cleaning and restocking in response to the pandemic.[67][20][21] Michigan-based automotive manufacturers General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler announced plans to gradually shut down plants starting March 19 and lasting until the end of the month.[68] Domino's Pizza, which is centered in the state, anticipated hiring up to 10,000 people to help meet an increased demand for food delivery services due to the pandemic,[69] while Jet's Pizza also prepared to hire ""hundreds"" of additional delivery drivers for the same reason.[70] Similarly, Michigan-based Meijer is projected to hire 40-50 new seasonal employees per store to help meet public demand during the outbreak.[71] On March 20, Kroger announced that starting the morning of March 23, all of its Michigan stores will be dedicating the first hour of business on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays to seniors, expectant mothers, first responders, and those with compromised immune systems.[72]
On the morning of March 16, Governor Whitmer announced a temporary order to close all bars and restaurants in the state to sit-down service, effective at 3pm the same evening until March 30. Carry-out and delivery options were excluded from the order, although restaurants were urged to limit in-building carry-out services to five customers at a time. The order also included fitness centers, theaters, casinos, and other venues that encourage large assemblages of patrons, with several exceptions, such as office buildings.[6][73] This order is expected to have significant economic impacts on businesses, and it prompted the Michigan Restaurant and Lodging Association to call for Whitmer to submit paperwork to qualify Michigan for the U.S. Small Business Administration Economic Injury Disaster Loan program.[73] The order also expands unemployment benefits to public health workers who become ill, people who need to take time off to care for children, and others, until April 14.[74] On March 19, the Michigan Strategic Fund unanimously voted to approve a $20 million economic relief program meant to help struggling small businesses affected by the pandemic.[75]
Most of the state's sports teams were affected. Several professional leagues began postponing or suspending their seasons starting March 12. Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training on that date. Also, on March 16, they announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, which affected Michigan's team, the Detroit Tigers.[15] Also on March 12, the National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, which affected the Detroit Pistons.[17] On March 14, Detroit Pistons power forward Christian Wood reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.[76] In the National Hockey League, the season was suspended for an indefinite amount of time, which affected the Detroit Red Wings.[16]
In college sports, the National Collegiate Athletic Association cancelled all winter and spring tournaments, most notably the Division I men's and women's basketball tournaments, which affected colleges and universities statewide.[18] On March 16, the National Junior College Athletic Association also canceled the remainder of the winter seasons as well as the spring seasons.[77]

Malta ,"
During the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, the first case of COVID-2019 in Malta was found positive on an Italian 12 year-old schoolgirl on 7 March 2020. The girl and her family were in isolation, as required by those following the Maltese health authority's guidelines who were in Italy or other highly infected countries. Later, both her parents were found positive to the virus. Further cases have been found later, with a total of 110 cases as of 24 March.
Health authorities have through legal means enforced people coming from highly infected countries for self-quarantine, failing which they may be fined for public health risks. While strict measures are being enforced by health authorities, the Maltese government has been criticised over lack of serious preparation for an outbreak. The government responded by saying that the matter should not be politicised.
A mandatory quarantine has been imposed on travellers and those who were possibly in contact with those who went abroad. People with symptoms similar to those of the virus are required to also isolate themselves.
On January 24, the Superintendent for Public Health, Prof. Charmaine Gauci, predicted low exposure due to no direct flights between Malta and China.[2]
On February 24, the health authorities announced that all passengers arriving in Malta were screened by thermal cameras. Two thermal scanning devices were installed in Malta International Airport. Passengers disembarking from vessels at the Grand Harbour and catamaran terminal in Marsa were also scanned. At Mater Dei Hospital, all patients with respiratory symptoms were checked for COVID-19.[3]
On February 25, the Ministry for Health recommended travellers coming from Italy to self-quarantine for 14 days and for all citizens not to travel to regions of Italy affected by the outbreak.[4][5] As the Italy coronavirus outbreak proceeded south with the first case discovered in Palermo, panic buying ensued and supermarkets were emptied.[6][7]
Maltese chandlers and ship workers refused to board vessels from Italy to unload cargo, unless they were provided supervision and clearance by medical doctors.[8] The Malta Union of Teachers recommended members not to accept any homework from students who were unwell and requested students and teachers who visited countries affected by the virus to stay home.[9]
Some work places requested their staff who recently returned from Italy to work from home as well as deferred non-essential travels to Italy.[10]
On March 11, a travel ban has been placed on trips to Germany, France, Spain and Switzerland, in addition to the ban on trips to Italy. Additionally anyone travelling back from mentioned countries must follow a mandatory self-quarantine. Disobeying the order makes the individuals subject to a €1,000 fine.[11]
On March 16, The Maltese Government has announced more measures upon the recommendations of health authorities. With effect from Tuesday 17 March at 11:59pm, all bars (excluding take-away), restaurants (excluding deliveries), gymnasiums, clubs, cinemas and tombola halls must remain closed. The fines for persons who do not respect the mandatory quarantine as directed by Government will increase from 1000 euro to 3000 euro for each time this obligation is breached. Meanwhile, residents of Malta who are currently abroad are encouraged to return home as soon as possible. Likewise, tourists who are in Malta and planning to leave, should do so imminently. The Government reaffirms its appeal for responsibility and cooperation by the general public to ensure that Malta succeeds in keeping a low curve of Covid-19 cases.
On March 19, A financial package of almost €2 billion was unveiled by Prime Minister Robert Abela to assist businesses in the wake of Covid-19 spread. While keeping the health aspect of the Maltese and Gozitans as an absolute priority, Government is also safeguarding the country's economy which guarantees the livelihood of the people of Malta and Gozo.
On March 20, all passenger flights inbound to Malta were temporarily suspended after 23:59 of March 20, 2020. In this regard, the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs is trying to assist those persons who have a Maltese passport and/or valid Maltese Residence Permit to return to Malta from areas where scheduled flights have been or will be cancelled. Travellers who do not manage to return to Malta by midnight between the 20 and 21 March, are urged to contact the Situation Centre at the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs (MFEA) by not later than Saturday 21 March. The Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs also wishes to recall that on March 13, Malta introduced a mandatory 14-day quarantine period for all arrivals into Malta. This affects returning residents and all persons arriving in Malta.
As from Monday, March 23, at 8am, non-essential retail was stopped. This includes outlets selling clothes, jewellery, toys, videogames, books, electronics and household goods, among others. Excluded from this prohibition are supermarkets, bakeries, groceries and pet shops, among others. Non-essential services will also be stopped. This includes hairdressers, beauticians and tattooists, among others. Excluded from this prohibition are postal services, medical services, transport services and banks. Also, as from Monday 23 March 2020 at 8am, any type of organized public and mass gatherings will be prohibited. A fine of €3000 euro will be imposed for each time these obligations are breached. The announced decisions are suitable for the current stage of Covid-19 and aimed at safeguarding the health of the general public.
On March 11, Prime Minister Robert Abela announced ban on all sea and air travel (except for cargo) and a mandatory quarantine on travellers returning from the most infested countries of France, Germany, Switzerland and Spain from that day onwards, together with Italy, for which it applied for the previous 14 days. Infringements were to be met with a €1,000 fine per day.[12]
On March 12, the Prime Minister announced a number of measures including:
As of March 13, mandatory quarantine was extended to travellers returning from any country. This was also published on the Malta Tourism Authority's and Air Malta's websites.[14][15][16]
Further to abuses reported from spot checks, Malta tripled it's mandatory quarantine fine to €3,000 each time on March 16.[17] Later on in the evening, Prime Minister Dr. Abela informed the nation that all gyms, bars and restaurants would temporarily closed. Food and Beverage outlets were to be allowed to operate only if they were offering take away and/or delivery service.[18]
On March 22, Health Minister Chris Fearne announced three more measures:
Any infringements were to be charged with a €3,000 fine each time.[19]
In the evening of March 23, the Maltese authorities warned that the fine for those infected are up to €10,000, and are already being enforced.[20][21]
On 7 March, Malta reported its first 3 cases of coronavirus: an Italian family consisting of a 12-year-old girl and her parents, who arrived in Malta on 3 March from Rome after a holiday in Trentino. The girl was the first case, with the parents testing positive for the coronavirus later in the day. They had been in self-quarantine since arriving from Italy, and they are now held in isolation at Mater Dei Hospital.[22]
As of 8 March 2020, 540 tests have been carried out. This includes all those who were in contact with the infected family. Other than the family, all tested negative. Reports of other cases were dismissed as dissemination of false information.[23] A further 10 people were tested on 9 March with one positive result reported positive in the evening, bringing the overall number to 4 cases.[24] The man did not follow quarantine regulations for the first two days, which caused outrage among those possibly affected.[25] His daughter was found also positive, becoming the fifth case.[26] The fourth and fifth cases were reported as being Norwegians living in Malta.
In the morning of March 11, the 6th case of COVID-19 was confirmed with the patient being a Maltese man coming back from Italy. That same evening, the 7th case was confirmed and the patient was a relative of his who had travelled with him to Italy.[27][28]
In the morning of March 12, the 8th and 9th cases of the COVID-19 were confirmed.[29]
By midday of March 13, 889 tests had been carried out in Malta and consequently 3 further cases of the COVID-19 were announced, bringing the total to 12.[30] All cases were imported from abroad. The 10th case was a Maltese man, 45, who returned from Münich on March 6, 11th case is an Italian man, 40, who returned from Paris on 6 March, and the 12th case was a Maltese woman, 30, who returned from Brussels on 9 March.[31] Later in the day, the first recovery form the virus in Malta was reported.
As of March 14 there were 18 cases.[32]
On March 15, further 3 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 were reported in Malta, bringing the total to 21.[33] In total 1,385 tests had been carried out, split between 722 tests on people who came from abroad and showed symptoms, and 663 tests on people who did not go abroad but displayed some sort of symptoms.[34]
On March 13 and 15, the first and second cases recovered from the COVID-19 coronavirus in Malta. The two individuals were to remain under quarantine in view of the revelations that the virus can re-emerge within survivors.[35]
[36]

Alberta ,"
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Alberta is an ongoing viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The Canadian province of Alberta has the third-most number of cases of COVID-19 in Canada during the 2019–20 worldwide pandemic. By March 24, there were 358 confirmed cases and two deaths.[1][2] As of March 24, 2020[update], of the tests conducted to date, 32,418 were negative and 358 were positive.[2] The majority of cases were in the Calgary zone, which had 214 confirmed cases by March 24. Jason Kenney, the Premier of Alberta, working closely with the Emergency Management Cabinet Committee, followed the recommendations of Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Deena Hinshaw, in response to the ""rapidly evolving global threat"". A state of public health emergency was declared on March 17. Alberta's public health laboratory was able to dramatically increase tests for COVID-19, reaching 1,000 a day by March 8, 2020. By March 20, ""World-wide, Alberta has been conducting among the highest number of tests per capita.""[3]
Statistics are provided in daily reports by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Deena Hinshaw, and posted on the Government of Alberta's website.[3] As of March 24, there were 357 confirmed cases; 60 percent of these were in the Calgary Zone. Two people have died since the beginning of the pandemic in Alberta.[1]
In a March 4 statement, Hinshaw said that there were no confirmed presumptive COVID-19 cases in Alberta, and the risk at that time was low. Hinshaw advised Albertans to prepare in case COVID-19 should arrive here in Alberta by having ""three days’ worth of essential items like food, water and medicine on hand in the event of any emergency.""[4] She cautioned against panic buying and advised Albertans to ""plan ahead"".[4]
On March 5, Hinshaw reported Alberta's first presumptive COVID-19 case. On February 21, a woman who was in her 50s, and had been on the Grand Princess Cruise ship had returned to the Calgary zone—an area that includes Calgary, Nanton, Canmore and Claresholm on February 21 and had tested positive.[5] Hinshaw said that more positive cases were found as a result of the work of public health teams who had contacted the 44 Albertans repatriated from the Grand Princess.[6][7]
On March 9, Hinshaw said that tests had revealed the fifth, sixth, and seventh cases of COVID-19 in Alberta. Case five was an older woman who had been on the Princess Cruise. Case 6, in the Calgary zone, was a young man who had travelled to Ukraine, Netherlands and Turkey.[8] Case seven was a woman who was on the MS Braemar Caribbean cruise ship.[8] Hinshaw said that, COVID-19 ""can spread person-to-person by larger droplets, like from a cough or sneeze…or by touching contaminated objects or surfaces, then touching your eyes, nose or mouth.""[8] Hinshaw acknowledged the work of Health Link, and Alberta's public health laboratory, among others. The laboratory ""dramatically increased"" capacity for running tests for COVID-19. On March 7 300 tests were performed and on March 8 alone they performed 700 tests.[8] Since all of the cases tested in Alberta were subsequently confirmed, ""positive samples tested by Alberta laboratories no longer require further confirmation"" from the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Laboratory (NML).[8]

In her response to the March 11 decision by the World Health Organization to ""officially declare COVID-19 a global pandemic"", Hinshaw said that this ""reflects the seriousness"" of COVID-19, which is ""not like other threats we have seen in the past few decades. It is more severe than seasonal influenza, and more contagious than viruses like SARS.""[12] She said that the virus ""can be contained"" as was the case in ""countries like Singapore.[12] At that time, people who had confirmed COVID-19 cases in Alberta, had recently returned from trips to ""Iran, Egypt, Spain, Washington State and Mexico.""[12] As a result, the province requested that ""all travellers returning from Italy"" self-isolate for two weeks. As well, airports in Calgary and Edmonton would begin screening starting on March 14.[12]

Alberta ordered all daycares to close, all K-12 schools to suspend classes and close to students, and all post-secondary institutions to suspend in-person classes and switch to online classes on March 15. Grade 12 diploma exams will still occur.[24]

She described how these steps were undertaken to ""flatten the curve"". ""The more we can slow the spread of the virus down, the less likely it is that there will be a surge of cases that overwhelm our health system's capacity to care for those who need hospitalization or intensive care."" She announced that Alberta Health Services was preparing for an ""increase in the number of cases that need hospital care"" so all scheduled and elective surgeries were postponed.[34] She listed activities that would be prohibited under the state of emergency declared by Premier Kenney.[34]

Hinshaw said at her March 18 update, ""We have had to weigh lives against livelihoods. And in order to save lives, I have had to make recommendations that will take away livelihoods from many Albertans over the next several weeks to months. There are no easy solutions to the situation we are in, not only in Alberta but around the world.""[37] Both Premier Kenney and Hinshaw said that Alberta ""may not reach the peak of the current coronavirus outbreak for weeks, and that drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus may be needed until the end of May.""[37] Hinshaw said that ""first wave of the outbreak could reach its peak in Alberta around mid-April"" and that ""officials expect another wave of the illness in the fall.""[37]

Lebanon ,"
This article documents the impacts of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Lebanon.
On 28 February, the Minister of Education Tarek al-Majzoub announced the closure of all educational institutions starting on 29 February until 8 March.[23] The decision was seen as unnecessarily strict by some universities including the American University of Beirut, the Lebanese American University, and the Univeristé Saint-Joseph who called for evidence-based decision-making to avoid unnecessary panic. Nonetheless, the universities did abide by the decision and close after discussions with the Minister of Education.[24] The American University of Beirut has consequently formed an expert committee for independent advising on the pandemic.[25]
On 6 March, the Minister of Health Hamad Hassan declared that ""Lebanon is no longer in Coronavirus containment stage"" following the entry of several new cases to Lebanon coming from countries previously classified as not infected, and urged the population to take preventive measures such as avoiding public like resorts and theaters.[26] Following this statement, the closure of schools, universities, and nurseries was extended to March 14.[27]
In reaction to the pandemic, several religious institutions in Lebanon decided to act proactively changing traditional ceremony methods to limit the spread of the virus. Churches and Mosques have been cleaned and disinfected, and practices have been adjusted. Within Christian communities, churches have emptied fonts of Holy water, and communion is carried out by handing the Eucharist instead of placing directly in the mouth. Similarly, within Muslim communities, it was recommended that people use their own prayer rugs and do ritual cleaning at home. Instructions by both religious parties recommend greetings without hand-shaking nor kissing.[28]

On February 21, 2020, the international Lebanese website, ""Lebanon Info Center""[35], was the first Lebanese website to officially cover the COVID-19 situation in Lebanon, with its page ""Coronavirus (COVID-19) Emergency - Lebanon"", thus, it was the first to offer official emergency and cases numbers, non-commercial recommendations and advises that are based on science and the actual situation on the Lebanese territories.
On March 12, 2020, a media site in Lebanon, The961, announced[36] the launch of a live tracker monitoring the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in Lebanon in real-time, manually cross-referencing three sources by directly communicating with the Ministry of Health, World Health Organization and the Lebanese Red Cross.[37] In the announcement thread, The961 founder, Anthony Kantara, explained the frustration of the lack of consistent and clear information as the motivator. The dedicated page also includes the latest news, updates and FAQs surrounding COVID-19.[38].
On March 19, the Information Minister Manal Abdul Samad launched a government site dedicated to the COVID-19 outbreak in Lebanon.[39] However, the website updates may depend on the ministry availability constraints.
As the first flight introducing coronavirus patients was a flight from Qom, Iran -- a city plagued by the coronavirus -- some Lebanese citizens and media have cast blame onto Iran and Hezbollah for being silent about the issue and not taking necessary measures against it. Some agents blamed Iran for bringing in the virus to the country to begin with. Following that, Information Minister Manal Abdul-Samad warned against involving political tensions in the pandemic.[40]
During the coronavirus outbreak, many problems appeared between employers and employees. Thus, many were forced risking their lives to get the job[41].

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was first manifested by a cluster of mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia.[21] The sequence of the virus was soon published on an open-access database.[22] Measures taken by China were praised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and some foreign governments.[23][24][25] China's response has been more transparent than how the country responded to SARS in 2003.[24][26] 
However, delayed and controversial responses by the Wuhan and Hubei authorities failed to contain the outbreak in the early stage which led to criticism from the public and the media.[27] By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China.[28][29][30] By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus infection-associated pneumonia and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths.[31] All provinces of mainland China initiated the highest response level to public health emergency.[32] WHO declared the outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern"" on 31 January[30] for fear that the virus spread beyond China to where there is no robust healthcare system despite its confidence that China was ""doing all that it can"".[33]
Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a ""grave situation"" facing China.[34][35] The Party Politburo formed a special leading group for epidemic control, led by Premier Li Keqiang. The Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers across the country have been checked for their temperatures.[36] Commands for epidemic control (CEC) have been formed in different regions including Wuhan and Hubei. Many inter-province bus services[37] and railway services have been suspended.[38] By January 29, all Hubei cities were quarantined.[39] Curfew laws were implemented in Huanggang, Wenzhou,[40] and other mainland cities.[41] The region also sees a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gear despite itself being the world's manufacturing hub for these products.[42]
On 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China exceeded those from within for the first time; the WHO praised the effectiveness of measures taken in the country.[43] By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day at the height of the crisis. On 13 March, the number of newly imported cases passed the number of domestically transmitted new cases for the first time.[44]
With the increasing reported cases of infections, fear upgraded along with regional discrimination in China and racial discrimination beyond China despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments.[45][46] Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with endorsements and counter-rumor efforts by media and governments.[47][48] The government has worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis, and to portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light.[49][50]
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.[51]

Sophisticated modelling of the outbreak suggests that the number of cases in China would have been many times higher without interventions such as early detection, and isolation of the infected.[52]

The countries and international organizations that have sent aid and funds to Government of Serbia, to help fight the pandemic:
Seeing as Coronavirus spread throughout Europe, on February 26. president Aleksandar Vučić called for a press conference where he addressed the possibility of the virus impacting Serbia. This news conference made headlines the following days after a pulmonologist Dr. Branimir Nestorović made joking statements about the virus, calling it ""the most laughable virus in the history of the mankind"" and suggested that women should travel to then virus-affected Italy for shopping. The president, who was visible in the background expressing amusement and chuckling at this during the TV broadcast, later denied any accusations of portraying the virus as such by Dr Nestorović.[55][56]
I cannot believe that the same people, who survived sanctions, bombing, the day-to-day bullying of all kinds, can get scared by the most laughable virus in the history of mankind, which [only] exists on Facebook.I appeal to the people to stop trusting unproven information. The epidemic in China is at its end, it started on 7 December [2019] when the first case was reported. It is already known that virulence of the virus is in decline, hence the virus becomes more and more weak as the time passes by. But the virus is weak in any case. Here's something regarding women... The estrogen definitely  protects women, they have mild symptoms and they don't die from this virus. So, women, you can go shopping to Italy, I've heard that, now, there will be huge discounts there, because now nobody wants to go to Italy. So, prepare your husbands mentally for that. I am joking, but for real, I think, I don't understand. Couple of days ago I was shocked when that story (about the virus) started because the virus itself was laughable. This is the third variant of SARS and MERS, the corona viruses, this is the third variant and is the weakest of all three. The first two went unnoticed, and now, suddenly, this third one... I see now borders are being closed, planes don't fly... An absolute nonsense."

Washington (state) ,"
The first confirmed case of the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States was announced by the state of Washington on January 21, 2020. Washington made the first announcement of a death from the disease in the U.S. on February 29 and later announced that two deaths there on February 26 were also due to COVID-19. Until mid-March, Washington had the highest absolute number of confirmed cases and the highest number per capita of any state in the country[2] when it was surpassed by New York state. Washington has had 123 COVID-19 deaths  as of 6:06 p.m. March 24, 2020.[1] Many of the deceased were residents of a nursing home in Kirkland, an Eastside suburb of Seattle in King County.
Washington had 2,469 confirmed cases, as of 6:15 p.m. March 24, 2020.[1] Public health experts agree that the true number of cases in the state is much greater than the number that have been confirmed by laboratory tests. It is very difficult to know the true number since most people experience mild illness and testing is not widely available.[1]
Jay Inslee issued a statewide stay-at-home order on March 23 to last at least two weeks.[3]
On January 21, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first U.S. case in a 35-year-old man living in Snohomish County. He had returned from Wuhan, China, to the U.S., landing at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport on January 15, without any symptoms. He reported to an urgent care clinic with symptoms of pneumonia on January 19 and was transported to Everett's Providence Regional Medical Center the following day.[10][11][12] He was released from the hospital on February 3 after two weeks of treatment, including the use of the anti-viral drug remdesivir,[13][14] and went into isolation at home.[15][14]

Officials said there was no evidence he contracted the virus through travel and they suspected community spread of the disease in King County.[23][24] The man had not been tested for the virus until February 28, partly because the lab in Washington had only recently become able to conduct tests, and partly because until late February the CDC had been recommending testing only for those with COVID-19 symptoms who had recently traveled to China.[25] Public health officials also reported two confirmed cases in the Life Care Center nursing home, including a woman in her 40s who was a health care worker at the facility.[26]

Many scheduled public events went on as planned, including a Major League Soccer fixture between the Seattle Sounders FC and Columbus Crew SC at CenturyLink Field on March 7. It was played in front of a crowd of 33,080, making it the smallest crowd to ever attend a regular season MLS match in Sounders history.[152] Pundits attributed the lower attendance to the coronavirus as immunocompromized fans and others who did not want to attend the match due to the outbreak were offered full refunds.[153][154] ESPN noted the effect the governor's ban on gatherings in Puget Sound area would have on sports, especially if it should be expanded to Eastern Washington; the first round of the 2020 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament was scheduled to be held in Spokane in March.[106] NCAA basketball was subsequently cancelled altogether. On March 12, Major League Baseball cancelled the remainder of spring training, and on March 16, they announced that the season will be postponed indefinitely, after the recommendations from the CDC to restrict events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks, affecting the Seattle Mariners.[155]

This is why most Seattle to Alaska cruise itineraries visit Victoria, and changes in Canada can impact Seattle-based cruises.""[167]  On March 14, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a 30-day no sail order impacting all cruise ships subject to USA jurisdiction.[168][169]
The landmark Space Needle closed on March 13 through March 31.[170] Pike Place Market remained open as of March 13[update].[171]

Several public transit agencies in Western Washington announced cuts to service and free fares to avoid contact between passengers and drivers. King County Metro, the largest operator serving Seattle, will reduce service and suspend the South Lake Union Streetcar.[176] Large agencies in the Puget Sound region are also anticipating a decline in revenue from sales taxes, which would cause delays or changes to major projects.[177]
On March 24, 2020, the Port of Seattle stated that a Transportation Security Administration security officer working at Seattle–Tacoma International Airport had tested positive for COVID-19.  The officer had last worked on March 21 at Checkpoint 5 which would now be closed for cleaning. [178]

"
Taiwan ,"
As of mid-March 2020, the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a more moderate impact in Taiwan than in many neighboring countries, with relatively few infections overall.[2][3][4] The first case was announced on 21 January 2020. 
The ROC government integrated data from the national healthcare system, immigration, and customs authorities to aid in the identification and response to the virus. Government efforts are coordinated through the National Health Command Center (NHCC) of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, established to aid in disaster management for epidemics following the 2004 SARS outbreak.[5]
The Journal of the American Medical Association states that Taiwan engaged in 124 discrete action items to prevent the spread of the disease, including early screening of flights from Mainland China and the tracking of individual cases.[6][3]
On 21 January, the first case in Taiwan was confirmed in a 50-year-old woman who just returned to Taoyuan International Airport from her teaching job in Wuhan.[7][8] She reported on her own initiative and was hospitalised without formal domestic entry.[8] The first domestic case was diagnosed in Taiwan on 28 January.[9] The first death in Taiwan was confirmed on 16 February involving a man in his 60s who had Hepatitis B and diabetes.[10] A woman in Taiwan was reported to have tested positive for novel coronavirus on 19 February 2020, though she had not traveled outside of Taiwan for two years.[11] Five new cases of coronavirus were reported in Taiwan on 29 February 2020, four of which marked the first transmission of the disease in a hospital setting.[12] Taiwan's fiftieth case of coronavirus was confirmed on 13 March 2020, an American expatriate who hosted four United States citizens at his home in Taiwan.[13] The next day, three new cases of coronavirus were confirmed to have been imported from Europe.[14] A Taiwanese national aboard the Diamond Princess tested positive on 6 February.[15] As of 19 February, five Taiwanese nationals aboard the ship tested positive.[16] Two Taiwanese who fell ill on the Diamond Princess were discharged from Japanese hospitals in February 2020.[17] The nineteen other Taiwanese passengers on the Diamond Princess were quarantined in Taiwan until 7 March 2020. All tested negative for coronavirus, and were released.[18] The index case for coronavirus in Taiwan recovered from the disease and was discharged from hospital on 6 February 2020.[19] Approximately a week later, a second Taiwanese national, the tenth case of coronavirus, had also recovered.[20] As of 23 March 2020, 29 people have recovered from coronavirus in Taiwan.[21] On 15 March, Taiwan announced six new cases, all imported.  Health authorities are tracing contacts of these persons.  Taiwan's health minister has advised people to remain in Taiwan and not to travel at all.[22] On 20 March 2020, Taiwan reported 27 new cases, the highest single-day increase.[23] The second death linked to coronavirus in Taiwan was announced on 20 March, and involved a man in his 80s, who had no recent travel history, but did have hypertension, diabetes and relied on kidney dialysis.[24]
As of 25 March, there are 235 confirmed cases, including two deaths.[25][24] Among the confirmed cases is a Taiwanese man in his 50s who was fined NT$300,000 for failure to report his symptoms and attempting to conceal his subsequent activities, leading to a potential contamination incident at a ballroom in Kaohsiung.[26]
Imported cases: 178 ; Locally transmitted cases: 37
On 31 December 2019, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) implemented inspection measures for inbound flights from Wuhan, China in response to reports of an unidentified outbreak.[27] The passengers of all such flights were inspected by health officials before disembarking.[27] A six-year-old passenger who transferred in Wuhan and developed a fever was closely monitored by CDC.[28] At this time, there was alleged to be 27 cases of the new pneumonia in Wuhan.[28]
By 5 January 2020, the Taiwan CDC began monitoring all individuals who had travelled to Wuhan within fourteen days and exhibited a fever or symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections. These people were screened for 26 known pathogens, including SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and those testing positive were quarantined.[5]
On 20 January, the government deemed the risk posed by the outbreak sufficient to activate the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC, 中央流行疫情指揮中心),[29][30][31] which mobilized government funds and military personnel to facilitate face mask production.[citation needed] Originally established as a level 3 government entity,[30] the CECC was promoted to level 1 on 28 February.[32] The CECC has coordinated government responses across areas including logistics for citizens on the Diamond Princess, disinfection of public spaces around schools, and providing daily briefings with Chen Shih-chung, the Minister of Health and Welfare.[5]
After the first case of the coronavirus was reported on 21 January, the Taiwanese government announced a temporary ban on the export of face masks for a month on 24 January to secure a supply of masks for its own citizens;[33][34] on February 13, this was extended until the end of April.[35]  On 6 February, the government instituted a mask rationing system, requiring citizens to present their National Health Insurance card.[36][37] Prior to its implementation, the system was extended to holders of the Alien Resident Certificate, and people with valid entry permits.[38] People with odd-numbered identity documents were permitted to buy masks on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; those with even-numbered identity documents were to buy masks on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; anyone is allowed to buy masks on Sundays. Adults were allowed to buy two masks each visit and children four, with the restriction that a minimum of seven days must elapse since the last purchase. The date restriction for children under thirteen years of age was revoked on 27 February.[39][40] Starting 5 March, adults were permitted to buy three masks weekly, and the children's quota was raised to five.[41] Masks were available for pre-order online from 12 March.[42] Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs assumed responsibility for distribution of masks to families of diplomats.[43]
On 2 February 2020, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center postponed the opening of primary and secondary schools until 25 February.[44][45] In early February 2020 Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center requested the mobilization of the Taiwanese Armed Forces to contain the spread of the virus and to build up the defenses against it. Soldiers were dispatched to the factory floors of major mask manufacturers to help staff the 62 additional mask production lines being set up at the time.[46] In early March, Taiwan's average production of surgical face masks reached 9.2 million per day.[47]
The Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation and the Taiwan Sugar Corporation increased production of 75 percent alcohol for use in sanitation.[48] On 25 February 2020, the Heping Women and Children's Hospital, a branch of the Taipei City Hospital [zh], was specially designated to care for patients with coronavirus.[49] From 4–31 March, the export of digital thermometers is to be banned.[50] On 16 March, the Tsai Ing-wen presidential administration announced that Makalot Industrial and other Taiwanese companies would begin domestic mass production of protective gowns, ending a reliance on American imports from DuPont during the pandemic.[51]
The Special Act on COVID-19 Prevention, Relief and Restoration was passed by the Legislative Yuan on 25 February 2020, followed by a special budget for coronavirus expenses on 13 March 2020.
As of 14 March, persons returning to Taiwan from most of Europe, plus persons who have transferred through China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Dubai, must quarantine in-home for 14 days.[52] As of 17 March, foreign nationals permitted in the country, namely, those who hold Alien Resident Certificates or who are on urgent diplomatic, business or other special missions, can rent a room in a public quarantine center.[53] On 20 March, the CECC has raised global travel notice to level 3; citizens to avoid all nonessential travels.[54]
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, Level 3 travel alerts have been issued by Taiwan for every country/region globally.[55] Taiwanese authorities suspended tours to China starting in February 2020.[56] The ban's duration was extended through April 2020,[57] and expanded to cover Hong Kong and Macau.[58] Taiwan has also announced a ban of cruise ships from entering all Taiwanese ports.[59] In January, Italy banned flights from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.[60][61] However, China Airlines was permitted to fly Taiwanese nationals in Italy to Taiwan.[62][63] On 10 February, the Philippines announced a ban on the entry of Taiwanese citizens due to the One-China Policy.[64] Later on 14 February, Presidential Spokesperson of Philippines, Salvador Panelo, announced the lifting of the temporary ban on Taiwan.[65] On 23 February 2020, Taiwan banned frontline medical professionals working in hospitals from traveling to areas placed under a Level 3 travel alert.[66][67] The ban is to remain in place until 30 June.[68] On 16 March, the Executive Yuan announced that teachers and students at the secondary school level and below were prohibited from overseas travel until July.[69] Starting 19 March foreign nationals were barred from entering Taiwan, with some exceptions, such as those carrying out the term of a business contract, holding valid Alien Resident Certificates, diplomatic credentials, or other official documentation and special permits.[70]
In the aviation industry, Taiwanese carrier China Airlines's direct flights to Rome have been rejected and cancelled since Italy has announced the ban on Taiwanese flights.[72] On the other hand, the second-largest Taiwanese carrier, Eva Air, has also postponed the launch of Milan and Phuket flights.[73] Both Taiwanese airlines have cut numerous cross-strait destinations, leaving just three Chinese cities still served.[74]
Taiwan Capitalization Weighted Stock Index has decreased over 13.1% due to the coronavirus. Foreign investors have sold over NT$200 billion.[75] TAIEX has also hit 42-month low, closing at 8,681.34 points.[76] National Stabilization Fund decided on 19 March that it is essential to intervene the stock market.[77]
Taiwan's early deployment of epidemic control measures and follow-up actions have received international praise and approval.[82]
On 13 March 2020, the Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs arranged for Commander Chen Shih-chung to have a meeting with envoys and representatives from various countries, and the epidemic prevention methods were affirmed.[83]
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated that the Israeli government would use Taiwan's experience to fight the epidemic.[84][85]
On 10 March, the Japanese news site Foresight published an article by a freelance journalist named Nojima who is familiar with Taiwan affairs, analyzing Taiwan's policy decisions regarding the epidemic.[86] Japanese media also carried out long reports on Chen Shih-chung, Tang Feng and others. Tang Feng received the most attention in Japan.[87]
Due to tensions between the Democratic Progressive Party-affiliated President of Taiwan Tsai Ing-wen and the Chinese government, Taiwan has been excluded from the World Health Organization. The WHO asserts that it is in contact with the Taiwanese government on a technical level. Fake news, mostly from Chinese netizens rather than the Chinese government, has become an issue. False reports of the outbreak spreading out of control in Southern Taiwan began in early January. Disinformation increased before the 11 January  Taiwanese presidential election between the incumbent Tsai Ing-wen and Kuomintang politician Han Kuo-yu. China has been criticized for failing to contain disinformation as it has the capability to do so through the Great Firewall.[88]
On 15 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand would follow Taiwan's example in their strategy to fight the epidemic.[89] Several news in New Zealand have also mentioned how Taiwan has done to prevent the coronavirus.[90][91]
During late-February when South Korea was suffering from its domestic outbreak, the supplies of masks were running out. South Korean news started to emphasis Taiwan's masks policies, including ban on masks exports and masks selling policies, while criticizing the South Korean government for being too slow to react.[92]
U.S. newspapers and magazines have suggested Taiwan and other Asian nations have done a better job at combatting the coronavirus than the U.S.,[93][94] and mentioned how Taiwan has banned the export of masks and boosted mask production.[95]
On 11 March, the Senate unanimously passed TAIPEI Act, with the goal of supporting Taiwan's attempts to join international organizations. [96] On 18 March, the American Institute in Taiwan announced that the United States would cooperate with Taiwan on researching and developing vaccines and rapid tests.[97]
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialized civil aviation agency of the United Nations, rejected Taiwan's participation amid the novel coronavirus outbreak, which impacted Taiwan's ability to gather information from the international organization. In response to public inquiry on the organization's decision on Twitter, ICAO commented that their action is intended to ""defend the integrity of the information"".[98] The United Nations Secretary General described these inquiries as a misinformation campaign targeting ICAO.[99]
The World Health Organization (WHO) have listed Taiwan as part of China, which resulted in multiple countries including Italy, Vietnam and the Philippines briefly banning flights from Taiwan in January and February 2020, despite the disease not then having reached epidemic status in Taiwan.[100][101][102][103][104]
Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Research Center hosted an interactive map which initially listed Taiwan under the category ""country/region"", along with Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. On 10 March, Taiwan's name was switched to Taipei and environs, a designation used by the World Health Organization. When a news organization reached out, the associate professor in charge of the project claimed they would be changing it back to Taiwan immediately.[105][106] By 12 March, Taiwan was restored to the map, and the university stated that it would adhere to naming conventions developed by the United States Department of State.[107]
Although Taiwan is excluded from the World Health Organization due to opposition fom China, and thus has limited access to shared scientific information and data, the country's response has been lauded in international press.[108][109][6][110] Despite its proximity to China and large human flows, Taiwan has recorded the lowest incidence rate per capita – around 1 in every 500,000 people.[110] Success factors cited have included the fact that the country's vice president, Chen Chien-jen, is an epidemiologist who had obtained a doctoral degree at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health;[109] and the lessons learnt from the SARS epidemic in 2003, which hit Taiwan hard. Infrastructure, including the establishment of a national health command center integrating relevant agencies; data analytics; policies aimed at keeping healthcare affordable; and extensive educational outreach were put in place following the SARS outbreak.[108][109] Researchers at Stanford Health Policy researcher published an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association arguing that Taiwan's action plan – which included 124 discrete actions and coordination to be implemented in the first instance – including travel bans, quarantines, surveillance steps, social distancing – had saved Taiwan from a serious epidemic.[6]
The Taiwanese government announced the ban on the export of face masks before the epidemic had spread to many countries, which caused controversy; however, after the outbreak of the epidemic, people rushed to buy masks in many countries around the world.[111] Incidents of face mask confiscation by the government also occurred in mainland China, the world's top face mask manufacturer.[112][113]
In early February 2020, the Executive Yuan adopted the recommendations of professors Huang Li-min (黃立民) and Chang Shang-chwen (張上淳) of the National Taiwan University Medical School, advocating that healthy people do not need to wear masks in open spaces. On 8 February, Chen Shih-chung, commander of the Central Epidemic Prevention Center, further stated that there was no need to wear a mask on public transportation.[114] This caused a storm of protest. The main point of contention is that public transportation such as buses and MRT carriages are confined spaces, and viruses are transmitted more easily than in open spaces. This action is likely to increase infection.[115]

Denmark ,"
This article documents the impacts of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in mainland Denmark and may not include all the contemporary major responses and measures. The first confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark was on 27 February 2020.[1] As of 23 March 2020, there have been 1,450 confirmed cases in Denmark.[8] In Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, the first case of COVID-19 was announced on 16 March.[9][10]
From late January to early February, several groups of Danish citizens were evacuated from China. All were placed in quarantine and tested; none were infected.[13]
On 27 February 2020, Denmark confirmed its first case when a man from Roskilde tested positive for COVID-19 at Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde. He was an editor from TV 2 who had been skiing in Lombardy in Italy and returned to Denmark on 24 February. He had mild symptoms and was placed in home quarantine.[1][14]
On 28 February, a man who had returned home from a ski holiday in Northern Italy on 15 February tested positive at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen and was placed in home quarantine.[15] The case was considered problematic because of the relatively long time that had passed from the person returning to Denmark to him contacting the authorities, increasing the period where he might have infected others and potentially making it more complex for the authorities to locate everybody that had been in close contact with him.[16][17]
On 29 February, a man who had returned home from a conference in Munich, Germany tested positive at Aarhus University Hospital.[18] Another attendee at the conference in Germany, an Italian man later found to have COVID-19, is the presumed origin of the Danish man's infection. The Dane was an employee of the Department of Dermatology at Aarhus University Hospital. He had mild symptoms and was placed in home quarantine.[19]
On 1 March 2020, a person who was already in home quarantine was tested positive. The person had been in contact with the man tested positive on 28 February.[20]
On 3 March, five people that had visited northern Italy and one person that had visited Iran were tested positive for COVID-19. All six were placed in home quarantine.[21][22]
On 4 March, there were four more cases confirmed in (mainland) Denmark and the first confirmed case was reported from the Faroe Islands (an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark), bringing the total number of confirmed cases to fifteen. All the new cases were placed in home quarantine.[23] The case in the Faroe Islands was a man with mild symptoms that had returned home from a conference in Paris, France.[24]
On 5 March, there were five new confirmed cases.[25] One of the cases was former Danish national football player Thomas Kahlenberg, who had been infected at a birthday party in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. This forced the Danish clubs Brøndby and Lyngby, and the Dutch club Ajax to place some of their players and coaches, who had recently met with Kahlenberg, into quarantine.[26] Kahlenberg described his symptoms as similar to a flu and he was placed in home quarantine.[27] On the same date, the first Dane that had been confirmed infected on 27 February also became the first Dane to be declared fully recovered.[4]
On 6 March, there were three new confirmed cases, including one in the Faroe Islands (the second case for this archipelago).[28]
On 7 March, there were six new confirmed cases.[29] Most Danes confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 had contracted it abroad and they had infected a few people in Denmark (there had been no person-to-person spread within Denmark where the source was unknown).[30]
On 8 March, there were eight new confirmed cases, including a patient first admitted to North Zealand Hospital Hillerød with symptoms resembling pneumonia.[31] Another mild case where the patient was placed in home quarantine was the first person confirmed to have COVID-19 in the North Jutland Region, meaning that all five regions of Denmark now had cases.[32]
On 9 March, there were 53 new confirmed cases, bringing the total in (mainland) Denmark to 90. Among all those infected, six were in hospital, but none of them required intensive care.[33]
On 10 March, there were 172 new cases, bringing the total in (mainland) Denmark to 262. Among the new cases was one patient admitted to hospital, bringing the total to seven.[34]
On 11 March, there were 252 new cases, bringing the total in (mainland) Denmark to 514.[35] One of the cases, who likely had become infected at a meeting where another attendee was infected, caused particular concern because the person worked in a nursing home. As a result, the elderly at the nursing home were isolated in their own rooms, they were closely monitored and tests were being performed.[36] Among all the infected people in Denmark, ten patients were in hospital, including two in intensive care.[35]
On 12 March, there were 160 new confirmed cases, bringing the total in (mainland) Denmark to 674.[37] Among these were two at the nursing home where the elderly had been isolated and closely monitored since the day before because an employee was tested positive.[38] On the same date, former footballer Thomas Kahlenberg announced that he had been declared fully recovered, making him the second publicly known recovery in the country.[7] Whereas many early cases were related to people returning from ski holiday in northern Italy, many cases discovered later were related to people returning from ski holiday in Tyrol in Austria.[39]
An 80-year-old man with a history of heart disease tested positive after having a heart attack and dying in the North Jutland Region. Although unclear whether the virus had played a role in it,[40] the authorities counted it as the first fatality related to COVID-19 in Denmark.[41]
On 13 March, there were 127 new confirmed cases, bringing the total in (mainland) Denmark to 801.[42] In addition, the Faroe Islands had their third confirmed case.[43] Among all the infected people in Denmark, 23 were in hospital, including 4 in intensive care.[44]
On 14 March, there were 26 new confirmed cases in (mainland) Denmark, bringing the total to 827.[45] Another 6 were confirmed in the Faroe Islands, bringing the total to 9 in this archipelago.[46] The second person died from COVID-19 in Denmark, in the Capital Region. It was an 81-year-old that was already weakened due to other serious diseases.[41]
In mainland Denmark,[note 2] Aalborg University Hospital, Aarhus University Hospital, Hvidovre Hospital, Odense University Hospital, Rigshospitalet and Zealand University Hospital Roskilde have sections prepared for serious cases of COVID-19 that require treatment,[47] as well as patients that are elderly or have pre-existing conditions and therefore are particularly vulnerable to the disease.[48] Other hospitals were required by the regions to prepare lists of non-essential operations that can be postponed. This would allow the manpower, space and equipment to rapidly be allocated towards an outbreak of coronavirus.[49] On 11 March 2020, the first hospitals began postponing non-essential operations as a preparation for future cases of COVID-19,[50] and on 17 March this was done in all hospitals nationwide.[51] Initially, all testing of samples for SARS-CoV-2 was performed at the Statens Serum Institut, but on 25 February (before the first confirmed case in the country) this was expanded to all the hospitals that also had sections that were ready for treating serious cases of COVID-19.[47] In early March, other hospitals started to perform the tests.[52] On 6 March, Aarhus University Hospital made a ""drive-through"" test facility (similar to those used in South Korea) where a person can be tested without having to leave his/her verhicle, but people using it still have to phone their personal doctor or the doctor-on-call (Danish: Lægevagten) for instructions first.[53][54] On 10–11 March, Aalborg University Hospital, Regionshospital North Jutland Hjørring and Zealand University Hospital Roskilde introduced ""drive-through"" test facilities.[52][55]
On 11 March, the Danish Health Authority announced a change of strategy, which means that only people hospitalized with severe signs of respiratory illness or shortness of breath, will be examined for COVID-19 infection. As a consequence, COVID-19 is being under-reported and health officials expect the actual number to be significantly higher than the number reported.[56]
According to the guidelines by the Danish Health Authority, all infected people that have no or mild symptoms and are not considered particularly vulnerable are placed in home quarantine with daily contact from health professionals. Anybody that has been in close contact with someone known to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 is also placed in home quarantine.[17][19][57] As of 2 March, 122 people were in home quarantine in Denmark because they had been in contact with an infected person in Denmark or abroad;[58] by 12 March this had increased to 1366 in Denmark and 31 in the Faroe Islands.[59] It is expected to further increase as a result of new cases of COVID-19.[60] Should it become necessary, each region has its own facilities for quarantining at least one thousand people,[61] and if containment of SARS-CoV-2 through normal isolation fails, more drastic measures can be implemented using the Epidemic Law (Danish: Epidemiloven).[58][62][63]
Initially, the authorities strongly recommend that all events with more than one thousand people either are cancelled or postponed, but on 11 March the limit was lowered to one hundred people;[64] this recommendation covers March, but can be extended if necessary. Among others, football (including the Danish Superliga) and handball matches were without spectators or entirely cancelled, the Dansk Melodi Grand Prix did not have an audience, concerts and conferences were cancelled or postponed, and the Euroschoolsport tournament at Esbjerg High School where students and teachers from much of Europe were supposed to meet was cancelled.[65][66][67][68][69][70] The Folketing (Danish Parliament) cancelled some of their regular meetings and hearings, and when voting a clearing system will be used to avoid having more than 95 members in the main chamber at any one time.[71]
On 10 March, the authorities recommended that people that use public transportation should attempt to reduce their travel in peak hours, if possible people should walk or bicycle shorter distances instead, and anyone feeling sick in any way or suspecting that they might have COVID-19 should not use public transportation. In an attempt of increasing the space between people using public transportation, more busses and trains were added to the schedules, and there were stricter limits on the number of passengers allowed in each.[72][73] From 12 March, all intercity train rides would be limited to people with seat reservations.[74]
Starting 13 March 2020, all people working in non-essential functions in the public sector must stay home for two weeks.[77] In the private sector, employers are urged by the authorities to allow their employees to stay home in the same period and work from there if possible, although this should not affect functions that are essential to the society (such as pharmacy workers and people working with sale of food and maintenance of critical infrastructure).[78]
Starting 13 March, all secondary education (like gymnasiums), universities, libraries, indoor cultural institutions and similar places will be closed for two weeks. Starting on 16 March, all primary schools, daycare and similar places will be closed for two weeks.[77] Virtual (online) schooling will be used to some degree.[79] The municipalities are establishing limited daycare for children where the parents could not stay home and take care of them. Because of the vulnerability of elderly to COVID-19, it is strongly recommended that grandparents should not take care of their grandchildren.[80]
Starting 18 March at 10 AM, a number of further restrictions were activated: It became illegal to assemble more than ten people in public, all shopping centres and stores with close contact such as hairdressers and nightclubs must be closed, restaurants can only serve take-away, and other businesses must ensure that there is enough space between customers.[81]
Unlike previous restrictions on the number of people allowed to assemble, the new restrictions are not merely a recommendation, and breaking the new restrictions is associated with fines of DKK 1500.[81]
On 23 March, it was announced that the above lockdown measures would be extended for a further 2 weeks, and be in place until 13 April.[82]
The Danish Foreign Ministry has changed its travel guidelines several times during the coronavirus outbreak. During the peak of the outbreak in the Chinese mainland, Iran, the regions of Aosta Valley, Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, Marche, Piedmont and Veneto in Italy, Ischgl in Tyrol of Austria, and San Marino, all travel to these places was advised against, and during the peak in the rest of Italy, the rest of Tyrol in Austria, Madrid, Basque Country and La Rioja in Spain, parts of Germany, parts of France, parts of Switzerland, and Daegu City and North Gyeongsang Province (also known as Gyeongbuk) in South Korea, all non-essential travel to these places was advised against. On 13 March, all non-essential travel to the rest of the world was advised against because of the spread of the outbreak, restrictions introduced on foreign visitors (for example, restrictions of flights or forced quarantine), their healthcare system's ability to handle a major outbreak or other reasons indirectly related to the coronavirus pandemic.[83][84][85][86][87] On 13 March, the authorities recommended that all Danes that were abroad (excluding Danes that live abroad) should return to Denmark as fast as possible.[84][88] From 14 March to 13 April, all Danish borders will be closed, except for transport of goods, people with an important reason for visiting, foreigners leaving Denmark, and Danes and people with a 
residence permit returning to Denmark.[89][90]
On 3 March, the Danish Government required that all healthcare workers (also including anyone working with care of the elderly) that have travelled to a region with high risk of COVID-19 to stay home for two weeks from the date of their return to Denmark. This was done to reduce the risk of vulnerable people being infected.[91] As of 9 March, high risk regions are mainland China, part of South Korea, Iran, Italy and Tyrol in Austria, but are subject to daily reviews by the authorities.[92] Everybody else that has travelled to these regions are instructed to not visit places like nursing homes and hospitals in two weeks after their return to Denmark (anybody suspecting that they might be infected should phone their personal doctor or the doctor-on-call (Danish: Lægevagten) for further instructions[93]), and it is recommended—but not required—that they also stay home from work for two weeks.[94] This recommendation was supported by the employers' organisations in the country such as the Confederation of Danish Industry and the Danish Chamber of Commerce.[95][96] Kommunernes Landsforening, which represents the municipalities in Denmark, made similar recommendations for all children that had visited a high risk region; they should stay home from school, kindergarten, daycare and similar places in 14 days after their return to Denmark.[97] Foreigners that arrive in Denmark from a high risk region are urged—but not required—by the authorities to follow the same guidelines as Danes and localities for quarantine are available for people that do not already have a suitable locality.[98]
Starting on 9 March, passengers on flights that originated in a high risk region would not have access to Danish airport buildings, but instead were picked up directly from the plane in special busses that could transport them to their home or other locality of quarantine.[98][99] From 11 March, all flights from high risk regions were cancelled.[100]
As of 15 March, among nations with at least one million citizens, Denmark has the world's sixth-highest per-capita rate of positive coronavirus cases at 144.3 cases per million people.[101]
In the daily report published by Statens Serum Institut that covered all 785 confirmed cases in (mainland) Denmark as of the morning of 13 March (16 others were confirmed later during the day and not included), it was reported that 67.8% were male and 32.2% female.

The state's economy is largely dependent on NRI remittances and the economic slowdown of affected Gulf countries is expected to have a direct impact.[56] KSRTC, Kerala's state-owned public transport system has reported losses worth crores due to reduced number of travelers.[57] The practice of social distancing has also brought down the numbers of those who go out on weekends or do shopping, thus affecting local traders and vendors.[58]

Nepal ,"

The global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Nepal when its first case was confirmed on 24 January 2020. The patient only showed mild symptoms and had been discharged a week earlier with instructions to self-quarantine at home. Nepal had conducted 610 tests as of 23 March 2020[update], and confirmed one additional case of the disease. This second case, confirmed on 23 March 2020, was of a 19-year-old woman who had recently returned to Kathmandu from France via Qatar.[1] She is being treated in Teku hospital, Kathmandu. Her family has been put in quarantine at home.[2] Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital in Teku, Kathmandu, commonly referred to as Teku Hospital, is the primary hospital for the treatment of the disease, handling all suspected cases. The third case of COVID-19 was confirmed on 25 March 2020[3]
Nepal has poor health-care services and lacks medical infrastructure, staff and equipment; it is considered poorly prepared to handle a large scale disease outbreak. The government has taken various precautions to prevent the spread of disease. It has established health-desks at the international airport as well as on border checkpoints with India. Several districts including Kathmandu are in lock-down. Land borders with India as well as China have been closed, and all international flights suspended. All academic examinations were cancelled and schools and colleges have been closed. Long distance travel has been suspended domestically. Quarantine centres and temporary hospitals are being setup across the country. Laboratory facilities are in the process of being expanded as well. Hospitals have been setting up ICU units and isolation beds in preparation of a possible outbreak. The SAARC countries have pledged to cooperate in controlling the disease in the region. India, the United States and Germany have increased their support in Nepali health sector.
Nepal cancelled its international promotional activities related to Visit Nepal Year 2020. Its economy is expected to be severely affected by the pandemic due its effects on tourism, manufacturing, construction and trade.[4]
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by  severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).[5] The outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019 and recognised as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, as the first known pandemic that may be controlled.[6] As of 16 March, over 173,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 150 countries and territories, with major outbreaks in mainland China, Europe, Iran and South Korea, among others.[7] More than 13,500 people have died from the disease and over 96,000 have recovered.[7]
The virus primarily spreads between people in a way similar to influenza, via respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.[8][9][10]
The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.[10][11] Symptoms are most often fever, dry cough and shortness of breath.[10][11] Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment, but research is ongoing. Efforts are aimed at managing symptoms and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include handwashing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people (particularly those who are unwell), and monitoring and self-isolation for fourteen days for people who suspect they are infected.[9][10][12]
Nepal is a landlocked country with China in the northern side and India in the east, west and south. Nepal shares a 1,414 kilometres (879 mi) border with China's autonomous region of Tibet, in the Himalayas.[13] China is Nepal's second-largest trading partner.[14] Nepal has an open border with India in the east, west and south. Nepal lies in South Asia, one of the least developed and most densely populated world regions, that performs poorly in education as well as health care and sanitation metrics, and is therefore considered one of the highest risk areas for the pandemic, and also one of the least prepared.[15][16][17][18][19]
According to The Kathmandu Post, hospitals in Nepal have few ICU beds (just three in Teku Hospital) which are almost always occupied, with people in critical condition usually having to wait for the beds to become empty. It reported doctors as saying that it would be next to impossible to admit new patients to ICU as soon as they need them.[20] Teku Hospital, the only one designated for handling infectious disease, had built an isolation ward during the avian influenza outbreak a decade ago, but had never brought it into use, as it did not have experts to evaluate or maintain the required standards.[21]
As news of a new infectious disease in China broke, concerns were raised in Nepal over the high potential risk, the need to implement preventative measures and a severe lack of necessary medical equipment and infrastructure; according to Baburam Marasini, former director of Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, Nepal does not have any double cab ambulances to transport highly infectious patients safely, isolation wards in hospitals, or biosafety level-3 or better laboratories needed to test for highly infectious disease.[17]
As of 24 March 2020, Nepal has confirmed two cases of COVID-19 disease, both in persons who had recently returned from abroad. The first case was confirmed on 24 January in a 32-year-old man who had recently returned from China. The patient who had shown mild symptoms was completely cured by early February. The second case was confirmed on 23 March in a 19-year-old woman who had recently returned from France. She is being treated in isolation in Teku Hospital. On 24 March, a 30-year-old man suspected of the disease died while undergoing treatment in isolation in Bharatpur Corona Special Hospital.[22]
Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital is the designated primary hospital for the treatment of COVID-19. A temporary hospital, named Bharatpur Corona Special Hospital, has been established in Chitwan District. Nepal Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu was the only laboratory capable of testing for the disease as of 15 March 2020[update]; it was capable of conducting 500 tests a week and had a stock of 1,000 viral transport media (VTM) kits for transporting samples to be tested.[23][24] It had conducted a total of 610 tests as of 23 March 2020[update].[a][26]
A Nepali student who had recently reached Tasmania via Singapore tested positive for COVID-19 on 8 March.[27] On 9 March, the UAE's Health Ministry confirmed that two Nepalis in the country had tested positive for the virus.[28] On 16 March, it was reported that seventy four Nepali migrant workers were put into 14-day quarantine in Faro City, Portugal, after one of them tested positive.[29] Later, it was reported that only three of the quarantined were Nepalis.[30] Three Nepalis tested positive in Bahrain, two of them on 21 March and one on 22 March; three more were put into 14-day quarantine.[31]
A 66-year-old former British Gurkha soldier of Nepali origin died from COVID-19 in the United Kingdom on 17 March.[32]
A 50-year-old Anil limbu resident from Jackson Height, NY passed away in the United States according to Non Resident Nepali association. [33][34]
A 31-year-old student of Wuhan University who had returned home on 5 January,[35] was admitted with mild symptoms on 13 January and discharged on 17 January with instructions to self-quarantine at home after preliminary tests showed he may not be infected.[36] Although Nepal had the laboratories and the skilled manpower to test for the disease, Nepal did not have the reagents required. The reagents cost around Rs 17,000 per test and need to be bought in bulk, sufficient for about 200 tests. As there were no other suspected cases needing testing, the officials decided to send the samples to Hong Kong instead of buying the reagents.[37] The samples were sent to Hong Kong on 21 January.[38] On 24 January, the Health ministry confirmed that the test had come back positive. The ministry said the patient was under surveillance, those who came into close contact with him were being investigated, and health information on all passengers returning from China was being sought.[39] However, The Kathmandu Post quoted officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division as saying that no one knew of the patient's activity since he was discharged and that they were looking for him.[40] Later, they said that they had only spoken to the patient on phone; he had reported being in good health and was not asked to come in for check-up or monitoring.[41] The patient was confirmed completely treated when RT-PCR throat swabs returned negative for COVID-19 in followup assessments of 29 and 31 January.[42][43] None of the people known to have come in contact with the patient showed any symptoms after three weeks of the patient's return to Nepal, and it was therefore presumed that he had not transmitted the disease to anyone else in Nepal.[21]
On 17 January, urged by the WHO, Nepal began screening passengers arriving in Tribhuvan International Airport from China, Thailand and Japan, the three countries with multiple confirmed cases.[44] Eight persons manned the health desk. The airport did not have infrared scanners and was therefore using thermal scanners as preparations were being made to install the infrared ones. The passengers who showed fever were being asked to remain in contact and contact the hospitals if they showed additional symptoms.[45]
On 23 January, Dr. Bashudev Pandey, director of Teku Hospital, was quoted as saying that the hospital was on high alert, while three other hospitals – Nepal Police Hospital, Patan Hospital and Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital – would also treat the disease.[46] Six beds in Teku Hospital had been allocated for isolation of suspected patients.[45]
On 25 January, a day after the first case was confirmed, the Health Ministry informed that two other suspected patients were in isolation at Teku Hospital.[21] The hospital discharged them in the morning of 27 January without waiting for test results even though the results were due later that same day, raising concerns over its handling of the crisis. The tests which confirmed a negative result for both patients were conducted at the bio-safety level-2 labs of the National Public Health Laboratory, the first such tests to be performed in Nepal. Reagents sufficient for 100 tests were borrowed from the Centre for Molecular Dynamics and test kits were provided by the World Health Organisation.[47] A woman was in isolation awaiting test results as of 27 January.[48]
On 28 January, Nepal closed down the Rasuwagadhi border with China, bringing Nepal-China trade to a complete halt.[49] Bordering districts of India were reported to be in high alert, and medical personnel had been deployed to various entry points along the Indo-Nepal border.[50]
By the first week of February, Nepal reported a shortage of face masks, as people hurried to buy them following reports of the first confirmed case.[51] Districts bordering India began setting up health desks at border crossings.[52][53] The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division reported that it had devised its own treatment protocol based on the one developed by UN Health Agency and directed all private hospitals to strictly follow the guidelines in handling any suspected new cases.[21] By 1 February, Teku Hospital had handled five suspected cases all of whom tested negative.[54] On 4 February, the Minister for Health informed that three hospitals had been made capable of testing for the virus, and 43 beds had been made available for patients of the possible outbreak. He also informed that health desks had been setup in Pokhara, Chitwan and Bhairahawa.[55] On 5 February, Nepal donated 100,000 protective masks to China as a gesture of friendship.[56]
A village in Sindhupalchok District reported hundreds of cases with fever, cough and difficulty breathing, starting on 10 February.[57] On 12 February, the district ruled out the possibility that it could be COVID-19 based on travel history of people in the village.[58][59] Laboratory testing later confirmed that the outbreak was influenza but not COVID-19.[60]
As of 13 February, Nepal had conducted tests on 19 suspected patients. A Saudi Arabian national who only spoke Arabic and appeared to object to being kept in the hospital, fled from isolation, and could not be located. The health ministry said it would start using police to guard suspected patients at the hospital.[61]
On 14 February, the government was reported to have devised contingency plans to tackle the virus. Under Plan A, the government was preparing to evacuate Nepali citizens stranded in Hubei and keep them in isolation in Bhaktapur. Plan B included educating the people and distributing protective kits. The details of Plan C which would be implemented in case the disease actually spread and started killing people were not shared.[62]
Nepal evacuated 175, mostly students, who had been stranded across Hubei,[63] on 16 February 2020, using a Nepal Airlines chartered aeroplane[64] and placed them in a 14-day quarantine at Kharipati in Bhaktapur. Six other Nepalis were prevented from leaving by the Chinese government, while four of the applicants who had requested rescue later changed their minds. Although 180 Nepalis had applied for immediate evacuation from China by 2 February; the effort took almost two weeks, as the government struggled to meet WHO's evacuation standards, and find a suitable venue for quarantine. The government was criticised for its slow response; a Public interest litigation was filed at the Supreme Court demanding immediate action,[65] while the locals around the designated quarantine site in Bhaktapur protested the government's decision which the viewed as endangering to the local community.[66][67][68][69] On 19 February, the Health Ministry reported that all of the evacuees had tested negative.[70][71]
On 18 February, the Chinese Embassy in Nepal criticised The Kathmandu Post for republishing a Korea Herald piece critical of China's handling of the pandemic, accusing editor-in-chief Anup Kaphle of anti-China bias. In response, 17 editors from Nepalese mainstream press released a joint statement expressing concern about the singling out of the editor, and reminding the Chinese Embassy of diplomatic norms and constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the Press in Nepal; The Kathmandu Post published an editorial criticising the Embassy's actions. The Chinese embassy's actions were seen as uncharacteristic and surprising as China is known for non-interference in Nepal's internal matters.[72][73][74]
By the end of February, the health desk at Tribhuvan International Airport was screening passengers from China, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan and Saudi Arabia, but did not have sufficient manpower and equipment to screen all new arrivals. A total of six infrared scanners had been setup; the only thermal scanner had yet to be repaired, but plans were underway to purchase three more.[75] Passengers were not being asked to fill locator forms that would make it possible to track them down later.[76] It was also reported that the government was seeking help from the UN having failed to procure masks and protective gear due to global shortages.[77] On 29 February, the government formed a high level committee to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 under the leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishwor Pokhrel.[75] The government also decided to suspend promotional activities for Visit Nepal 2020.[78] Nepal suspended labour migration to South Korea.[79] India started screening passengers from Nepal and making masks compulsory for all visiting Nepalis.[77] It was also screening Nepalis travelling into India by land, at various checkpoints at the border.[80]

2 March: The Supreme Court issued an interim order to suspend flights to and from countries affected by the disease, in response to a public interest litigation. The government issued a travel advisory against non-essential travel to countries hardest hit by the disease, including China, Iran, South Korea, Japan and Italy.[81] The visitors coming from or via these countries would be required to submit a health certificate. Health checkpoints were to be established at all major entry points from India and third country citizens would be allowed to cross from select border check-points only. The Sagarmatha Sambad programme scheduled for April was also postponed.[81]
4–5 March: Due to a severe shortage of face-masks and protective gear as well as increase in price following a ban on export in China and India, some hospitals were reported to be sewing plain clothes masks as a precaution.[85] A shortage of hand sanitisers was also reported.[86] Everest Premier League, the domestic T20 cricket tournament was postponed indefinitely.[87]
8 March: Qatar imposed a temporary ban on arrivals from Nepal and other countries, affecting almost 40,000 labour migrants with valid work permits who were yet to leave.[88] Nepal Airlines and Himalaya Airlines suspended their flights to Doha indefinitely following the ban.[89]

It also declared two-week mandatory self- and home-quarantines for everyone visiting Nepal.[92][93] Labour permits for all countries were suspended indefinitely, including to workers who were only back home on holiday. The government also suspended issuance of no objection letters to students going for abroad study until 30 April.[94] The Province No. 1 government unveiled plans for two quarantine sites in the province, including one on a Koshi River island. It also assured plans were underway to provide additional equipment to health personnel, to set up health desks on border-crossings with India, to keep ambulances in standby and to maintain isolation wards in three major hospitals – BP Koirala Institute Of Health Science in Dharan, Koshi Hospital in Biratnagar and Mechi Hospital in Jhapa.[95][96] BP Koirala Institute of Health sciences in Dharan reported that a suspected patient had refused to remain in hospital and returned home.

Nepal had declared 2020 as the Visit Nepal Year and aimed to bring in two million foreign tourists, almost double the figure from previous year. As the pandemic spread and Nepal had to suspend air travel to and from China, the biggest source of international tourists arriving by air, Nepal suspended its promotional campaigns.[141]
Nepal's economy is expected to be negatively affected by the pandemic. The tourism sector has been reported to be suffering due to the absence of Chinese tourists, as well as the various travel restrictions imposed on travel globally. Manufacturing sector is experiencing a shortage of raw materials, most of which used to come from China. The situation is exacerbated by spread of the pandemic to the Middle-east which is the main source of remittance that makes up more than half of Nepal's GDP. Remittances were expected to sharply drop after Nepal suspended issuance of workers permit to Nepalis for all countries.[142] The wholesale and retail sector has also been affected due to fall of imports from China. The construction sector which imports most of its building materials from China has slowed down. As the Chinese contractors and workers who went home for the Chinese new year could not return, the public construction projects have also been affected.[143][144][145] The domestic airlines were reported to be struggling for survival as ticket prices dropped to half or a third of normal following a sharp decline in demand.[146] Number of international flights to and from Nepal had decreased by more than 50% by 13 March.[147] Nepal's import-dependent economy is also vulnerable to depreciation of Indian currency to which its currency is permanently pegged, as Indian economy suffers the impact of the pandemic.[148] 20,000 tour, trek and mountaineering guides lost their livelihood when mountaineering was suspended.[149][150]
The temporary blanket ban on animal markets imposed by China as a response to the pandemic is expected to curb wildlife poaching and trafficking through Nepal, as the Chinese traditional medicine which uses various body parts of endangered animals as its ingredients has been the biggest challenge to wildlife conservation in the region.[151]
The annual Holi celebrations, which fell on 9 and 10 March in 2020 saw decreased activities, low business and cancellation of organised celebrations.[152]
On 21 March a 20-year-old man was arrested on charges of spreading misinformation online through an unregistered fake news website and causing public fear, after audio tapes alleging cover-up of COVID-19 cases were found circulating online.[153] The same day, Nepal Army dispelled rumours circulating in social media that claimed Army helicopters were being used to spray disinfectants over settlements at midnight.[154]
The department of Commerce, Supplies and Consumer Protection conducted raids on 161 firms and fined 57 of them, a total of around four million Rupees in the month of Falgun (February–March).[155] It inspected multiple pharmacies and surgical shops in Kathmandu on 5 March and fined a total of Rs 430,000 for hiking prices and other offences.[156] On 10 March, four pharmacies were fined a total of Rs 800,000 after they were caught charging 1000% of normal price for surgical masks. Some groceries and LPG stores were also inspected. One million units of face masks were confiscated from a warehouse in Kathmandu and the owner arrested on 18 March, bringing the total of masks confiscated in the week past to 2.3 million. Around 50,000 units of hand-sanitisers were also confiscated from the black market. Around two dozen black marketeers had been arrested.[157] As the outflux of people from Kathmandu intensified, 23 transport entrepreneurs and workers were arrested on 20 March for overcharging the passengers.[158]
Nepal's pharmaceutical industry has been impacted due to lack of raw materials as a number of essential ingredients were previously imported from Hubei.[143] Nepal faced the prospect of a potential shortage of essential medicines when India imposed restrictions on export of 26 types of raw materials including of essential medicine citing disruption in the supply chain from Hubei; however India later agreed to relax restrictions in case of Nepal, and asked the Nepalese government to provide a list of names and quantities of essential medicines that it needed to supply to Nepal.[159]

Uruguay ,"
The first cases of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Uruguay were reported on March 13 by the Ministry of Public Health.[1] As of March 2020 there is an ongoing outbreak in Uruguay, with the first few cases imported from Italy and Spain and local transmission occurring.[2]
The majority of early cases were traced to a wedding with 500 people in Montevideo, attended by a Uruguayan returning from Spain who later tested positive. Various containment measures were introduced in mid-March, and doctors called for a shutdown of nonessential businesses and activities.
The first four cases, all imported, were reported on March 13. One of them had attended a wedding with 500 people,[3] and two others had taken a six-hour bus trip from Montevideo to Salto. Some of the other passengers on this ride were contacted by the authorities and developed symptoms.[4]
On March 14, it was announced that the two patients who took the bus ride on March 8 generated some 200 contacts, who were categorized as suspected cases with home quarantine recommended.[5][6]
Local transmission was established with two non-imported cases reported on March 15.[7] The first patients showed mild symptoms of COVID-19.[8] In the preceding days, more than 60 suspected cases had been analyzed and ruled out at air and sea ports in Uruguay. It is believed that the relatively late arrival of COVID-19 cases in Uruguay is related, among other things, to the country's scarce direct air connections with the countries most affected by the virus: China, Germany, northern Italy, Iran, and South Korea.[9]
On March 15 a doctor who works at two medical institutions tested positive. The patients who had visited him and the members of the medical team were contacted.[10][11]
On March 16, it was announced that one of the infected people was at a wedding in Paraguay and later on Friday, March 6, went to a Uruguayan Division 1 football club pre-game meeting, which generated at least 20 suspected contacts.[12][13]
On March 17 it was learned that other wedding attendees, three students at a private university who had attended in-person classes since then, had tested positive for the coronavirus. Their classmates were asked to quarantine.[14]
Of the first 29 confirmed cases, 26 were in the capital of Montevideo, which is home to about a third of the country's population. Two cases were in Salto and one in Maldonado. Nine of the cases were imported and the remaining twenty were transmitted from one of the confirmed cases. Many of these early cases were related to a March 7 wedding in Carrasco with 500 people, attended by a returnee from Spain who later developed symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19.[15][16][17] Of the country's first 55 cases, 44 were traced to the wedding.[18] The passenger returning from Spain later said, ""I asked if there were any measures at the airport because I was coming from Europe and they said no.""[18]
Uruguayan doctor Martín Stryjewski said that a ""cultural change"" was necessary. In Uruguay it's traditional to greet people with a kiss on the cheek; Stryjewski recommended that people instead greet each other without touching. He also recommended that people avoid sharing mate, a Uruguayan beverage that is traditionally drunk communally, sharing a straw. He advised that people use diluted bleach to clean frequently touched surfaces.[19]

On March 16, the government issued an order to close all border crossings except Carrasco International Airport.[23] The border with Argentina was closed effective March 17 at midnight.[24] The closure included river and air travel.[24] President Luis Lacalle Pou said that the idea of closing the border with Brazil was ""a little more complex"", because it is a dry land border, and many people living near the border live a ""binational life"".[24] Lacalle Pou advised people over 65 to stay at home.[24] Flights from the United States were suspended effective March 18,[25] and from Europe effective March 20 at midnight (00:00),[26] at which point the airport was to close.[23]

To free up hospital beds, surgeries were permitted to be rescheduled.[26] The Ministry of the Interior announced that patrol officers would circulate with loudspeakers asking citizens not to meet in large groups.[22]
Temperature checks were introduced in prisons and activities for prisoners restricted.[27]
On March 17, the Ministry of Economy and Finance published a list of prices of products such as alcohol gel, rectified alcohol, and surgical masks, in order to prevent price gouging. The list gave locations where the products could be obtained and their prices at each location.[19][28]
On March 18, the government said ""everything is on the table"", including the possibility of a ""general quarantine"", to address the virus.[15] Amid thousands of unemployment insurance claims, the government announced subsidies and other measures to cushion the economic impact of the pandemic.[29]

Georgi Todorov, a Bulgarian doctor with experience in viral breakouts in Ghana, criticised the handling of the COVID-19 threat. In particular, Todorov stated that Bulgaria's health administration is so rife with nepotism that it cannot come up with any coherent response; as a result, infectious disease specialists were not taken into account when formulating response policies, and no specific locations were designated for potential COVID-19 cases. Todorov further assumed that infected individuals may have not been identified because of improper application of testing procedures.[40]
According to Prof. Milan Milanov, former manager of Pirogov Hospital, the government's response was ""catastrophically delayed"", although he added that there's no room for panic as COVID-19 treatment was ""the same as with influenza"".[41]
"
the Czech Republic ,"
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic saw its first three confirmed cases in the Czech Republic on 1 March 2020. On 12 March, the government declared a state of emergency, for the first time in the country's modern history for the area of the entire country. On 15 March, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš declared a nationwide quarantine from 16 March until 24 March,[2] with some exceptions[3][4] affecting around 10.7 million people.

As of 28 January, 20 suspected cases were tested with negative results.[1]
As of 28 February, 170 suspected cases were tested with negative results. 307 people were in home quarantine imposed by a regional hygiene station, of them 77 were in South Bohemian Region.[1]
The Minister of Health, Adam Vojtěch, reported that three cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory.[5] The three cases are treated at the Bulovka Hospital in Prague; one of the cases had been found in Ústí nad Labem, but was transported to the Bulovka Hospital.[5] All cases are connected with northern Italy. One case is a man who returned from a conference in Udine, the second case is a woman (tourist, US citizen) studying in Milan and the third case is a man who returned from a skiing holiday in Auronzo di Cadore.[6][7]
Another case was confirmed, a woman who was on skiing holiday in Auronzo di Cadore and was staying in the same hotel as the man from a previous case.[8]
Another case was reported, a woman from Ecuador studying in Milano, a friend of the US tourist.[9]

Bulovka Hospital in Prague has announced that all but two tourists (case #2 and #5) have been released to home quarantine.[20] Visits to general hospital wards and retirement homes are banned with exceptions for visiting minors, people with limited legal capacity, new mothers, and hospice and terminal ill patients.[21]
The first cases in Olomouc Region, Vysočina Region and Pardubice Region.[22]
The National Security Council decided to close all primary and secondary schools and universities, while kindergartens and pre-school remained open. All public events with over 100 people attending were banned.[23]
First case in Moravian-Silesian Region.
A patient in middle age at Bulovka Hospital is incubated in an intensive care unit - the first case in serious condition. Also 84-year senior in University Hospital Brno [cs] was announced to be in the same condition, but the head doctor from Brno hospital denied it.
The deputy of the minister of health said any travel by Czech citizens is undesirable, and that if the spreading continues to speed up, public transport may be limited and the Czech Republic may close its borders.[24]
The first cases in the South Bohemian Region, Karlovy Vary Region and Liberec Region. In total the disease has been confirmed in all 14 regions of Czech Republic, most of them (50) is in Prague.[25]
The Czech government has declared a state of emergency for 30 days.[26][27] Pubs and restaurants will be closed from 8 pm to 6 am, while swimming pools and other sports facilities, clubs, galleries and libraries will be closed completely. Public events with more than 30 people will be prohibited. A special regime will be introduced on the borders with Austria and Germany, people will only be able to enter or leave the Czech territory via 11 border crossings[28] using cars, as international bus, train and boat lines will be canceled.[29] Foreigners from high-risk countries (including Germany and Austria) would be banned from entering the country and Czech nationals would be prohibited from travelling to those countries.[30][27]
A new set of policies has been declared by the Czech government, including closure of borders from Monday (with exceptions) - see details in Policies section.
The government held a meeting to decide if a nationwide quarantine should be declared to mitigate damage inflicted by the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and slow down further spreading. Less than an hour before midnight, Prime Minister Andrej Babiš announced the approval of the nationwide quarantine, restricting personal movement, allowing only going to work or carrying out work, getting provisions and necessary visits to family.[citation needed]
Starting at midnight, an hour after the nationwide quarantine declaration was approved the previous day, nearly 11 million Czech residents were placed under quarantine. The quarantine bans all non-work related travel, excluding necessary shopping, and visiting doctors, hospitals, and close relatives in need. Solitary walks outdoors in nature away from other individuals was also permitted.[2]
In addition to the quarantine, further travel restrictions were imposed barring all non-residents from entry into the country, and virtually all Czech citizens from travelling abroad.[2]
The first three cases of coronavirus recovery were reported.[31] All 3 are from Děčín, Ústí nad Labem Region and were in the group of first infected in the country.[32]
The government now bans export of imported medication. Three coronavirus cases are in the Intensive care unit, two taxi drivers and a woman at Bulovka hospital, two of them are stabilised.[citation needed]
The Czech government approved a ban on going out anywhere in public while not wearing a surgical mask or covering one's nose and mouth with a scarf. It also ordered that all shops serve only customers aged 65 and over between 10 am and noon.[33]
The government changed the time when shops are allowed to serve only senior customers to between 7 am and 9 am.[34]
Two planeloads of protective gear purchased by Czech Government in China was delivered to Prague airport: a heavy cargo plane Antonov An-124 provided through NATO Support and Procurement Agency brought 100 tons of masks, respirators and coronavirus tests from China, while a China Eastern plane brought seven million facemasks.[35]
This helped to aleviate shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in the Czech Republic. According to Security Information Service, the shortage happened after Chinese embassy conducted massive purchases of respirators available on Czech market during January and February and transferred them to China.[36]
First death reported: a 95-year-old man.[37] While COVID-19 positive, at the time of death, the man was not at ICU and did not suffer from pneumotis that is a COVID-19 specific type of death. The man suffered from chronical heart issues and had also a pacemaker. The cause of death was formally established as a ""complete exhaustion of organism"".[38]
The local health authority in the Moravian-Silesian Region announced that 80% of COVID-19 examinations that were conducted in the region in the previous days with use of fast-test kits that government procured and airlifted from China (altogether 300,000 kits bought by the Czech Government for total price of CZK 54mil - approx. USD 2,1mil) came out wrong when double-checked through standard testing.[39][40]
The Czech government confirmed that restrictions on free movement of people and other measures were extended until April 1st.[41]
A second death was reported: a 45-year-old man died after six days in a hospital in Havířov. The patient was suffering from advanced cancer with metastases to multiple organs. The cause of death was established as multiple organ failure due to cancer but COVID-19 infection accelerated the patient's death.[42]
A third death was reported: a 71-year-old woman died in Všeobecná fakultní nemocnice in Prague. The woman suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as other illnesses, so it wasn't immediately clear that she may be COVID-19 positive. Only after being hospitalized the woman informed doctors that her relative recently returned from Italy and was then tested for COVID-19. The woman was connected to a ventilator but died three days after start of hospitalization.[43]
An Uber driver hospitalized in Prague became the first patient in the Czech Republic to receive remdesivir treatment. The patient had been on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for days before his remdesivir treatment started.[44]
Apart from the Uber driver on ECMO, there were 19 other patients in hospitals in serious condition, all of them connected to ventilators.[43]
Some 3,000 people were tested that day, which means that the country reached the same per capita rate of testing per day as South Korea. Emulation of best practices from countries like South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong was one of the stated aims of government measures.
Detailed information was reported regarding most of the first 99 cases, up to 12 March 2020.
This led to shortage of FFP3 respirators for use by healthcare providers which lasted for weeks after the ban was passed.
Ban on export of hand sanitizers listed in Annex 1, Category 1 of EU Regulation No. 528/2012 (with exemption of small amounts for personal use).

People lacking prescription may pay for their own test. Prices vary depending on hospital from CZK 1,300 to CZK 3,000 (€50 to €120). Some drive-through locations do not offer paid testing due to capacity limitations (i.e. they test only those with a prescription).
Military BSL-4 reserve hospital at Biological Defense Center in  Těchonín put into state of readiness.
Last-year students of nursing, paramedics, and several other related fields compelled to work duty, actual work subject to later call-up.
The main priority of affected nations currently is to move to a slower doubling time of new cases, to ensure less crowded hospitals and therefore a lower case fatality rate.[126][127]
Governments of different countries take different approaches to flatten the epidemic curve. Beside travel bans and isolation of complete communities, citizens are also often requested to stay at home and keep social distance.[126]
Research indicates that measures must be applied rigorously and immediately in order to be effective. Also, the national community's commitment to supporting / tolerating the restrictions and following the advice of health authorities plays an important role in the success of flattening the epidemic curve and limiting the spread of the virus.[128][129]
For example, in South Korea mass testing efforts were successful. The South Korean national testing capacity reached a staggering 15,000 tests per day. The Ministry of Interior in South Korea also rolled out a smartphone app that can track the quarantined and collect data on symptoms, so scientists are able to see more epidemiological data.[130]
Comparing cumulative numbers of confirmed cases in selected countries, including the Czech Republic,[131] shows the different curves of the epidemic in different countries.[132]
This chart shows the number of known cases and the pace at which the number increases on a logarithmic scale. The actual number of people infected may be, and likely is, significantly higher, as only cases where the virus was confirmed by laboratory testing are shown. Many cases may only have an asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic course of the disease and never seek treatment. In yet others, the infection may still be in the incubation period, when it is asymptomatic and may not yet be detectable even by testing.[133]
[132]
In epidemiology, the basic reproduction number (sometimes called basic reproductive ratio, or incorrectly basic reproductive rate, and denoted R0, pronounced R nought or R zero[134]) of an infection can be thought of as the expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection.[135] The definition describes the state where no other individuals are infected or immunized (naturally or through vaccination).
The higher the R ratio number, the faster the disease spreads. If R is less than one, the reproduction within the population decreases.[136][137]
Development of R ratio in the Czech Republic
R0 data are moved one day backward, as it makes more sense.

Belgium ,"

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Belgium on 4 February 2020, when its first COVID-19 case was confirmed in Brussels. The pandemic only started on 1 March, when many skiers who had spent the school holiday around carnival in the North of Italy were allowed to return to work or school.[5]
Efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak in Belgium have to be managed by the nine federal and regional health ministers, Maggie De Block (Open VLD, federal government), Wouter Beke (CD&V, Flemish Community), Christine Morreale [fr] (PS, French Community), Antonios Antoniadis [de] (SP, German-speaking Community), Bénédicte Linard [fr] (Ecolo, French Community), Valérie Glatigny [fr] (MR, French Community), Alain Maron [fr] (Ecolo, Brussels), Elke Van den Brandt [nl] (Groen, Brussels) and Barbara Trachte [fr] (Ecolo, Brussels).[6] with the support of:
Unlike most neighbouring countries (the Netherlands, France, Germany and the UK), the Belgian authorities were not willing to provide information or statistics on where the cases are located, beyond statistics for each region: Flanders, Brussels and Wallonia.[8] Sciensano started to publish statistics per province from 18 March onwards. The authorities do not disclose yet statistics per municipality.
On 29 January, Belgium issued a travel notice advising against non-essential flights to China, Hong Kong excluded, with some travel companies cancelling all flights to China.[9] Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled at the University of Leuven.[10]
Towards the end of January it became clear that Belgium had an insufficient stock of respirators and surgical masks but Jan Eyckmans of the Federal Public Service Health department claimed the Belgian hospitals had sufficient stock.[11][12] On 8 March the federal minister of public health stated she had a solution for the shortage of masks but was unwilling to disclose the potential vendor and the number of masks involved.[13] On 15 March, it became clear that the masks had not been delivered on time,[14] and the following day De Block announced that her department's order of 5 million masks might have involved fraud.[15][16] On 16 March hospitals such as the UZ Leuven called for the public to bring in FFP2 , FFP3 respirators or surgical masks[17] and the next day it became clear that De Block had blundered by ordering all 5 million masks from a single company (M.O.S.S.A. vof), a consultancy firm that had no track record in the medical field and was owned by Mahmut Öz, a Belgo-Turkish politician from her own political affiliation.[18] On 19 March a shipment of 100.000 FFP2 respirators arrived.[19] On 20 March a shipment from China of 5 million masks arrived at the airport of Bierset, but theses were surgical masks and not the type of respirators required to protect the medical staff.[20][21] Hospitals such as the Centre Hospitalier Interrégional Edith Cavell (CHIREC) reported that they were in dire need of protective masks.[22] Minister Philippe De Backer was charged with coordinating the efforts of the authorities to supply masks and respirators.[23]
On 1 February, Belgian nationals living in Hubei were repatriated on a series of evacuation flights arriving at Melsbroek Military Airport close to Brussels,[24] where they were quarantined and examined in a military hospital. People tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were transferred to the Military Hospital of Neder-over-Heembeek where they underwent a 14-day quarantine.[25][26]
On 4 February, Belgium confirmed the first case.[27] The patient, an asymptomatic 54-year-old male was one of nine Belgians repatriated from China.[28] He was quarantined at Saint-Pierre Hospital in Brussels.[27]
On 21 February a group of 10 Belgian citizens were allowed to return to Belgium after having been constrained on the MS Westerdam cruise ship for several days.[29] Two couples used public transport to return home, notwithstanding the requirement to be quarantined for 2 weeks.[30]
On 24 February, following the discovery of a COVID-19 case involving an Italian citizen, more than 100 Belgian citizens were put in quarantine in the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife that was put on lockdown.[31][32] Fifteen people were allowed to return on 28 February. The remainder were allowed to travel back to Belgium on 5 March, without having been tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[33]
On 25 February Belgian federal minister of health Maggie De Block asserted that ""Belgium was prepared"" for the possible arrival of cases of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.[34]
On 26 February the UZA clinic in Edegem started with the construction of containers to be able to cope with the increased influx of patients in the emergency department.[35]
On 1 March, a second case of coronavirus was confirmed in Belgium, a Dutch speaking woman who had returned from Crépy-en-Valois in one of the regions affected in France.[36] At the same time phase 2 of the health risk containment strategy was activated.[37] The yearly one week school holiday around carnival lasted from 22 February until 1 March 2020 and quite a few people go on ski vacation during that period. The number of detected virus infections therefore sharply rose upon the return of people having resided in the ski resorts of the North of Italy. The mayor of Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe, Olivier Maingain, was one of the only mayors to take measures to prevent the spreading of the new coronavirus by restricting access to schools, preschools, sports facilities and public places for persons returning from areas at risk[38] and only a few schools, such as the International School Ghent, quarantined pupils that returned from areas at risk such as the North of Italy.[39]
On 2 March six additional cases, making a total of eight, have been diagnosed. Five were found in Flanders and one in Brussels, all six having come back from Northern Italy.[40] Minister De Block mentioned there was no reason to panic and said Belgium could cope with the epidemic.[41] Some experts, like Marc Wathelet[42] and professor Herman Goossens of the UZA in Antwerp criticized the (lack of) measures taken by the Belgian government and called for wider screening for the virus.[43] Pharmacists complained they did not receive clear instructions from the authorities.[44]
As of 3 March, six additional cases were confirmed, making a total of 14 cases. One of the infected persons was a 17-year old teenager who returned to his school in Tienen after a ski vacation in the North of Italy.[45] Another person from Sint-Niklaas also returned from a skiing holiday.[46] A patient from Verviers was hospitalized in a Brussels clinic,[47] and two cases were found in Couthuin [fr] (part of Héron).[48] One patient is a 65-year-old male from Eupen who presented relatively severe symptoms and had not been to any of the regions with a higher risk of infection.[49][50] Steven Van Gucht of the Scientific Committee predicted that in the worst-case scenario the epidemic would cause 13,000 virus infections, with 2,000 to 3,000 hospitalisations and 500 to 700 patients in intensive care.[51] In a later interview he mentioned different numbers saying that 70% of the population (approximately 8 million persons) could become infected.[52]
As of 4 March, ten new cases were confirmed before noon, making a total of 23. Nine of the new patients recently returned from Italy. The other patient had contact with a prior case.[53] Four cases were in the Leuven area,[54] one case in Hasselt,[55] and one in Pelt.[56] In Wevelgem two related cases appeared. A complete family of 7 was infected upon their return from a ski holiday in the North of Italy. Initially the Belgian authorities did not want to test the family for the virus, notwithstanding the request of the family.[57] Additionally a teacher in a primary school in Wevelgem, who was on the same ski vacation as the family of seven and even went to work for two and a half days after the school holiday became sick and was diagnosed with the covid-19 virus.[58] The Agentschap Zorg en Gezondheid advised the school to not close down.[59] A retirement home in Gooik stopped receiving visitors as a precautionary measure, because one employee could have been in contact with the new coronavirus.[60] Joris Moonens, the spokesman of the Flemish Agency for Care and Health, expressed the opinion that this was not an appropriate measure.[61]
On 4 March 2020, the European Defence Agency (EDA) confirmed that a staff member had tested positive for coronavirus, marking the first confirmed case in the agencies of the European Union.[62] The senior EDA official had returned from a trip to Italy the previous week.[62] After returning from Italy, he attended a roughly four-hour meeting with about thirty other European Union officials last week before he started feeling ill on Saturday (29 February).[62] A military staff member of the European External Action Service who attended the meeting has also begun experiencing symptoms.[62] The EDA has cancelled all meetings until 13 March, and other European Union institutions are also taking precautions.[62][63]
On 5 March 27 new confirmed cases were reported by the government (16 in Flanders, 9 in Wallonia and 2 in Brussels), bringing the total to 50.[64] Of the 50 persons 1 patient recovered, 48 are quarantined in their home and 1 person is being treated in the Sint-Pietersziekenhuis.[65] The new cases were reported to be in Knokke-Heist, Zonhoven, Doomkerke [nl] (Ruiselede) and Vlierzele (part of Sint-Lievens-Houtem).[66]
On 6 March 59 new cases were reported by the government, bringing the total to 109 (65 in Flanders, 12 in Brussels, 31 in Wallonia and 1 cured). The new cases were amongst others reported in Oosterzele and Sint-Katelijne-Waver.[67] The Ministry of Health confirmed for the first time that infections occurred on Belgium territory.
On 7 March 60 new cases were confirmed by the government (40 in Flanders, 5 in Brussels and 15 in Wallonia), bringing the total to 169 (105 in Flanders, 17 in Brussels, 46 in Wallonia and 1 cured). The new cases were amongst others reported in Houthalen, Melle, Lokeren, Mere, Lede, Tildonk and Poppel.[68] The UZ Leuven confirmed they were forced to limit the number of tests for the virus because of a shortage of reagents for the test.[69] The ministry of public health mentioned that ""more and more infections are being contracted locally” but did not provide the information on how many.[70]
From 422 samples taken on 7 March 31 were tested positive on 8 March (16 in Flanders, 8 in Brussels and 7 in Wallonia), bringing the number of infections to 200. The ministry of health confirmed ""local circulation of the virus from various locations"" but did not disclose these locations.[71]
On 7 March it became clear that Belgium lacked enough reagents to do widespread COVID-19 testing and the National Reference Centre for Pathogens (NRC)[72] was forced to apply a system of triage.[69] Two surgeons from the Brussels Saint Pierre hospital addressed an open letter to prime minister Wilmès on 22 March demanding increased testing.[73][74]
On 10 March the total number of confirmed cases was 267;[75] that day the government advised to cancel any indoor scheduled events to be attended by more than 1000 people for the month of March. Prime minister Wilmès stressed this was not an interdiction but rather a recommendation.[76] Schools remain open but are advised to cancel trips abroad and multi-day excursions in general. Companies are advised to have their personnel work from home as much as possible and allow flexible working times to allow a better spread of public transport use throughout the day. The authorities called this 'reinforced phase 2'.[77]
Around 10 March the Belgian hospitals started to increase their number of intensive care units (ICU) from 1900 to 2650 in two weeks time, corresponding to an increase from 16.5 to 23.0 ICUs per 100 000 inhabitants.[78]
On 11 March ministers De Block and Maron announced that the first death on Belgian territory due to COVID-19 occurred on 10 March,[79] a 90-year-old female patient from Brussels who was being treated in Etterbeek.[80] Two more patients died on the same day, one person aged 73 and one person aged 86 who died in Sint-Genesius-Rode.[81] Zorgnet Icuro requested minister Beke to take stronger actions with respect to visitor access at retirement homes in Flanders.[82] Professors Herman Goossens and Marc Van Ranst expressed the opinion that more drastic measures were required for Belgium and questioned the limit of maximum 1000 people for indoor events set by prime minister Wilmès on 10 March.[83]
On 12 March 2 new infections were detected as well as 32 suspected cases in retirement home Ter Kameren in Watermaal-Bosvoorde, one of the biggest retirement homes of the Brussels region.[84] The total number of confirmed cases rose to 399. Approximately 20 patients (approx. 5%) out of those 399 were being treated in intensive care.[85] The Belgische Vereniging van Artsensyndicaten (BVAS/ABSyM) called for a closure of all schools at short notice and warned for a potential collapse of the health care system in Belgium.[86] In an open letter several Flemish rectors, two members belonging to the Coronavirus Scientific Committee that advises the Belgian authorities and several other experts urged the authorities to take decisive measures and to avoid non-binding instructions and guidelines.[87]
Late in the evening on 12 March, after a meeting of the National Security Council, the Belgian government ordered the closure of schools, discos, cafes and restaurants, and the cancellation of all public gatherings for sporting, cultural or festive purposes from Friday 13 March at midnight onwards.[88] It was stressed that the measures taken were not a lockdown because people are not required to stay home.[89] Earlier that day mayor Leopold Lippens already had ordered similar measures for his municipality of Knokke-Heist.[90] The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen informed the entire staff that 7 of their colleagues had tested positive, six of whom in Belgium. She also instructed ""all colleagues in non-critical functions"" to work from home with immediate effect until 29 March, while those ""who ensure critical functions"" would need to work in two shifts to minimize the risk of contagion.[91]
Experts and authorities expressed their indignation about citizens organising or taking part in so-called 'lock-down or corona parties'.[92][93] Mayors of municipalities close to the border with the Netherlands such as Paul Van Miert of Turnhout urged their Dutch counterparts to request their national authorities in the Netherlands to implement similar measures as in Belgium.[94]
The coronavirus pandemic sparked new debate on the ongoing federal government formation. Representatives of N-VA, PS, Open Vld, MR, CD&V and sp.a sat together on 14 and 15 March to talk about an emergency coalition.[95] This idea was however rejected by the PS and MR, and eventually these parties (except N-VA) together with Ecolo, Groen, cdH and DéFI opted to temporarily grant more competences to the caretaker Wilmès I Government instead, under the form of a new Wilmès II Government, still a minority, but no longer in caretaker status, allowing more flexibility to take quick decisions.[96][97]
On 16 March the King addressed the nation and called on all Belgians to respect the COVID-19 measures “for ourselves and for the most vulnerable among us”.[98]

On 20 March from 3 p.m. onwards Belgium closed its borders to all non-essential travel.[101] Earlier that day the governor of West Flanders had complained about Dutch and French citizens coming to Belgium for tourism or shopping.[102] That day the chairman of the Scientific Committee also expressed the hope that the measures that came into effect on 14 March would lead to a stabilisation of the number of hospitalisations starting from the mid of the week of 23 March.[103]
On 21 March Prof. dr. Erika Vlieghe of the Scientific Committee mentioned that the she expected the peak of the pandemic to occur early April.[104]

Hungary ,"
The first cases of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Hungary were announced on 4 March 2020.[2] The first coronavirus-related death was announced on 15 March through the official website.[3]
On 18 March the Surgeon General announced that the virus exists in every part of the country.[4]
At the end of January 2020, a Hungarian operational staff was formed, which was led by Sándor Pintér Interior Minister and Miklós Kásler, Minister of Human Resources, and included Surgeon General Cecília Müller, Károly Papp, Director of Security Department of Interior Ministry, János Balogh, National Police Leader, and the directors of National High Directorate of Disaster Management, Anti-Terrorism Center, Central Hospital of South Pest, National Healthcare Supplying Service and National Ambulance.[5] Staff has immediately announced its plan for security against the spread of virus.[6] After detecting the virus in the country, they announced that operational staff would held daily meetings at noon.[7]
On 1 February, the spokesperson of National Command of Penalty Execution (BVOP) announced that prisoners of Debrecen and Sátoraljaújhely[8] had started the production of sanitary masks. They produce 20 000 masks daily in a 12-hour shift, which are stored in different repositories all around the country.[9] They continually deliver these masks to the general practitioners.[10]
As at the beginning the pandemic was concentrated in and around Wuhan, the source of the virus, Hungarians living there who wanted to move back to Europe, were transported home through France. The affected seven persons were under quarantine for two weeks.[11] As they remained healthy during the next two weeks, they were released on 16 February.[12]
Due to the events and news connected to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, during February 2020, several goods—such as antiseptic arm cleaning materials, masks and non-perishable food – were on shortage in a lot of shops in Hungary.[13] Tamás Schanda, strategical and political under-secretary of Innovation and the Science Ministry said ""The Government understands the concerns of the people, but experts say it is unnecessary and pointless to hoard non-perishable food.”[14] The accumulation of goods declined quite quickly, and the detection of the virus in March did not cause measurable problems in shops.[15]
The Government of Hungary launched its official webpage and official Facebook page about the novel coronavirus, both on 4 March 2020.[16][17]
The first two known cases were students from Iran, who were studying in Hungary. One of them was enrolled at the Pharmacy Faculty of Semmelweis University.[18] The student did not comply with the preventive measures required by the university as a precaution. He did not remain home for two weeks, and instead, he attended courses held in English with 16 other students.[19] The other person studied at the Szent István University in Gödöllő, who after returning from Iran, went to a self-declared quarantine. He did not attend lectures at the university, but went to Saint Ladislaus Hospital, and declared that he had arrived from an infected territory.[20]
Both of them were transported to Saint Ladislaus Hospital.[19] They had mild symptoms. They arrived back in Hungary on 26 and 28 February.[21]
A third infection was announced on 5 March. He was a 69-year old British man who was working in Milan and travelled frequently between Milan and Debrecen. He developed a fever, so he visited his doctor. He was diagnosed and transported to Gyula Kenézy Hospital.[22][23] Shortly after, the fourth infected had been announced. She was a girlfriend of one of the Iranian students that were first diagnosed. She was proactively isolated when the virus was diagnosed in the Iranians.[24]
The fifth infected was identified on 7 March, a 70-year-old man, who may have been infected by his son. The son previously visited some other countries, such as Italy.[25]
The sixth and seventh infected persons were announced on 8 March. They were exposed to the earlier diagnosed five infected persons. One of them was a friend of one of the Iranian students who was participating in a birthday party. The other was the Hungarian wife of the British man in Debrecen.[26] The next day, two other people were found to be infected, and, like the previous day, one of the infected had also come in contact with the first infected Iranian student. The other one was the wife of the elder man who has been isolated.[27] On 10 March, three new cases were discovered with students related to the first infected Iranian student, so they had remained under quarantine.[28] A day later, a Hungarian woman was announced as the 13th infected. She had come into contact with the first person isolated in Debrecen. Due to this she was hospitalised for several days.[29]
The first death which may have been due to the coronavirus occurred on 11 March. A 99-year-old woman was in hospital, where she was operated on at Saint Imre Hospital. After the successful operation, she had fever and pneumonia. Her daughter – who visited her regularly – got pneumonia  the same day. Later, the daughter was diagnosed with COVID-19. Her mother was never tested and so not registered in connection with coronavirus.[30]
Three new cases were reported on 12 March. One was a student from Iran (a contact of the first case) whilst the other two were Hungarian citizens. One of the two Hungarians was a woman who had been in Saint Ladislaus Hospital for several days, the other one was a man travelling from Israel.[31] On 12 March János Szlávik, head of Infectological Department of South Pest Centre Hospital, confirmed that an Iranian citizen, held in quarantine, had recovered. All of his test results were negative.[32]
On 13 March, the number of known cases increased by 3, all of whom were Hungarian citizens. One of them, a 67-year-old man, had met several people from abroad in connection with his work. One other was a 41-year-old man, who had recently been in the Netherlands and England. The third one was a 27-year-old man, who had travelled to Israel with one of the already known infected people.[33]
On 14 March, 11 new people were diagnosed with COVID-19, bringing the total to 30; 6 were announced in the morning and 5 in the evening. All of the new cases were Hungarian citizens. The newly diagnosed patients include people who had been to Italy, and a person whose family member had returned from Austria.[34][35]
On the 15 March, 2 more people had been diagnosed with COVID-19, for a total of 32. Both of these cases were Hungarian citizens.[36]
On the same day, Sándor Szaniszló, the Mayor of Pestszentlőrinc-Pestszentimre announced the death of a patient at St Ladislaus Hospital who had been diagnosed with coronavirus. He is the first official victim of the pandemic in Hungary.[37] He was a 75 years-old man who had died due to infection with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and the COVID-19 sickness.[3]

Before the first infected cases (the Iranian students) were found, György Bakondi, Home Security Advisor of Prime Minister, announced Hungary would block the entrance of illegal immigrants to the transit zone, because many arrive there from Iran which is undergoing a notable outbreak.[48]
On 6 March, it was decided that no more visas would be issued for Iranian citizens.[49]
On 7 March – when the number of known infected people was 5 – it was announced that, due to security reasons, central national ceremonies related to the national holiday of 15 March would not be held.[50] For the same reasons, Gergely Karácsony, Mayor of Budapest announced that celebrations at the town hall were cancelled as well.[51] the same decision was made in several other big towns, such as in Székesfehérvár, Szeged,[52] Kaposvár[53] or Miskolc,Miskolc[54] is and a job fair planned to be held between 18 and 19 March at the University of Technology and Economics was also postponed.[55]
The frequency of disinfection on Budapest public transport vehicles has increased, and the rule about using only the first door for boarding has been suspended, to decrease crowding.[56] On 13 March, similar rules regarding getting on public transport were introduced in Miskolc as well.[57]
The National Ambulance Service has provided more ambulances across the country to make easier the handling of increasing patients.[58] 145 beds were freed for this cause in Saint Ladislaus Hospital, belonging to South Pest Central Hospital. Their capacity is now 81 rooms with 189 beds. If these fill up, other hospitals, capable of handling this type of situation, will also be used for quarantine locations elsewhere in the country.[50] Since 8 March visiting someone in a hospital or in any social institution which provides long term stay has been prohibited.[59]
Operational staff suggested the suspension of air traffic between Milan and Budapest as well as between Milan and Debrecen, because the European centre of the epidemic is in Northern Italy.[50] It has been fully adopted since 9 March. Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport does not allow any plane to land coming from Northern Italy.[60]

The ""Határtalanul” (Without Borders) programme, and other programmes allowing students to study a foreign language abroad, were suspended.

215 Filipinos were among the attendees of an international tabligh convention held from February 7 to March 1, 2020 at the Jamek Sri Petaling mosque near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 19 Filipinos tested positive and were quarantined in Malaysia. Two others managed to return to the Philippines and later tested positive by Philippine health authorities.[170]
There have been 10 confirmed cases of foreign nationals who went to the Philippines as of March 25.
The DOH uses the designation ""patients under investigation"" (PUIs) and ""patients under monitoring"" (PUMs) to manage suspected and confirmed cases. PUIs involved individuals who had a travel history to Wuhan but by February 3, the DOH has expanded the scope of PUIs to include individuals who had a travel history to any part of China.[7]
As of March 14, there are 912 total PUIs; 694 of which had been discharged or refused admission (but are still ""under monitoring""), 209 are currently admitted at a health facility (including 56 confirmed cases), and eight had died (only one of which is an unconfirmed case). The sole PUI mortality not confirmed resulting from the coronavirus is that of a 29-year-old Chinese national from Yunnan confined at a Manila hospital who died from pneumonia[173] and also tested positive for HIV.[174]
The first case overall in Mindanao is a resident of Lanao del Sur who went home from San Juan, Metro Manila[175]
The first confirmed COVID-19 case in the Cordillera Administrative Region is a resident of Manobo town in Abra province. The case confirmed on March 14, involved a 39-year old seafarer who came from the United Arab Emirates. He consulted a hospital in San Fernando, La Union on March 10 and was designated as a person under investigation after he developed fever but was allowed to go home to Abra. He attended festivities in Abra prior to visiting a relative in La Union.[176]
The second confirmed case in the region was a 61-year-old female Overseas Filipino Worker from Italy. The woman who returned to the Philippines on March 2 was admitted to the Baguio General Hospital, and is the first case to be admitted to a health facility in the Cordilleras. Her case was confirmed on March 23, 2020.[177]
The first COVID-19 case in Mimaropa was confirmed on March 20.[178] The case involved a 26-year-old male Australian tourist in Palawan who had already left the province at the time of confirmation. The tourist arrived in Manila on March 5 before taking a flight to Puerto Princessa. The man stayed for five days in a resort in San Vicente prior to seeking medical consultation after he exhibited symptoms. He was brought to the Palawan Provincial Hospital in Puerto Princessa for sample collection for testing on March 14. The tourist managed to secure clearance after two days to take a ""mercy flight"" to get out of the province to Clark after his fever subsided.[179]
The Philippine Council on Health Research and Development of the Department of Science and Technology (PCHRD-DOST) on February 7 plans to distribute an undisclosed ""functional food"" to help individuals with COVID-19 infection to combat the disease within a month. A ""functional food"" is described by the PCHRD-DOST as similar to how the herb locally known as tawa-tawa is used as a remedy against dengue. The undisclosed functional food is already used for other diseases and is not a drug that requires registration with the FDA.[180]
The PCHRD-DOST as part of the government's interagency committee proposed funding for screening for antibodies against COVID-19 in blood specimens collected from COVID-19 PUIs in the Philippines to help contribute to international efforts to understand the disease. However, there is no government-led research in the Philippines to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.[180]
The DOH has issued a reminder, that Level 2 and 3 hospitals cannot deny admittance of people suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 infection and refusal of admission is a ""violation of the signed Performance Commitment and shall be dealt with by the PhilHealth accordingly"". The department said that Level 2 and 3 hospitals can accommodate individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms while individuals in a serious or critical condition may be transferred to one of the DOH's three referral hospitals; the RITM, Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City and the San Lazaro Hospital.[181] On March 20, the DOH designated the Lung Center of the Philippines and the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Caloocan to cater exclusively to confirmed cases of COVID-19, in order to sustain manpower, medical equipment, and facilities amid the exponential rise of cases.[182]
On March 16, the DOH announced a revision on their protocol on hospital admission for COVID-19 positive patients. A week prior, the DOH has began sending both asymptomatic patients and individuals with mild symptoms back on their homes for quarantine and continued health monitoring until they have been deemed recovered. Priority are given to high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms for hospital admission.[183]
Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev announced that the Russian government is offering to donate to Filipino officials a Russian-developed over-the-counter drug called ""Cicloferon"" claimed to have cured the symptoms of COVID-19 on Russian patients. The FDA and DOH have classified the said drug as treatment rather than cure.[184]
Prior to January 30, there were no medical facilities in the country that can confirm cases of the virus.[21][186] Prior to that date, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa conducted preliminary tests on suspected cases to determine if they are infected with a coronavirus but could not detect the new strain on patients.[187] Samples from suspected cases with confirmed coronavirus infection had to be sent abroad to the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory in Melbourne, Australia, for confirmatory testing specifically for SARS-CoV-2 strain.[188]
In response to the pandemic following a cleared suspected case, the RITM began the process of acquiring primers and reagents to conduct confirmatory tests in the country.[189] On January 29, it was announced that the RITM has acquired confirmatory kits to be able to test cases in the country. A laboratory for the confirmatory test[188] became operational on January 30.[21]
The RITM is also training personnel of four sub-national reference labs of the DOH to help them develop capability to test samples from ""patients under investigation"" (PUIs). These laboratories are at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, the Baguio General Hospital in Baguio, the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City, and the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City. The DOH has also allowed private health facilities to seek testing accreditation.[190] By March 20, the four health facilities has started testing.[191]
Likewise, the Western Visayas Medical Center in Iloilo City was given accreditation by the DOH to conduct COVID-19 tests on March 18, 2020.[192] Testing sites are also being planned at the Bicol Public Health Laboratory[193] and Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center in Tacloban.[194]
There are also initiatives from local government units to set up their own testing centers including Marikina and Muntinlupa.[195][196]The Marikina city government procured 3,000 testing kits locally developed by UP-NIH. Its operation is still subject to approval by the DOH as of March 23.[195] Muntinlupa plans to set up a testing site at the Ospital ng Muntinlupa also subject to DOH's approval.[196]
By March 9, 2020, a total of 2,000 tests has been conducted at a rate of 200 to 250 people accommodated by tests per day.[197] The testing capacity of the Philippine government has been expanded by late March 2020. As of March 23, the RITM alone can test 600 people per day, other laboratories except the facility of San Lazaro Hospital can do 100 tests, while San Lazaro Hospital can do 50 tests per day.[193]
A testing kit for the virus was announced on February 4 to have been developed by the National Institutes of Health at the University of the Philippines Manila.[198] The kit was developed two weeks prior to the announcement and was subject to evaluation by the DOH.[199] The equipment is a polymerase chain reaction testing kit and is to be produced by Manila HealthTek. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the product a certificate of exemption on March 9 allowing it to be used under field validation until the testing kit receives validation from the World Health Organization. The testing kit is reportedly six times cheaper than its foreign counterparts.[200][201]
The RITM on February 26, reportedly is purchasing 19,000 testing kits from a source abroad.[202] The number of testing kits by March 9 is around 2,000 from a high of 4,500 at an unspecified date. The government experienced a shortage of testing kits and has prioritized individuals exhibiting symptoms for testing.[203]
The DOH announced on March 23, that it has distributed 100,000 testing kits to five operational testing facilities as well as the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City.[193]
In late March, some politicians were tested for the virus despite not showing any symptoms which causing public backlash amidst a shortage on testing kits since it was against DOH guidelines to test asymptomatic individuals.[205]
Ruffy Biazon, a member of the House of Representatives from Muntinlupa, called on the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) on January 22 to suspend flights from Wuhan to the Philippines. Royal Air Charter Service operates direct flights from Wuhan to Kalibo.[206] By then, Philippine travel visas under the ""visa-upon-arrival"" (VUA) program were denied to tourists from Wuhan.[189] On January 24, the Philippine government deported 135 individuals from Wuhan who arrived in the country through the Kalibo International Airport.[207] There were calls for a wider temporary ban on people entering the country from anywhere in China. Such move was supported by Senators Ralph Recto, Bong Go, Risa Hontiveros, and Francis Pangilinan. The DOH and the Office of the President find no urgent need for such measure.[208]
On January 31, a travel ban on all Chinese nationals from Hubei and other affected areas in China was imposed. The VUA program for Chinese tourists and businessmen was also suspended.[209] On February 2, a ban was introduced on all foreign travellers who visited China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the past 14 days;[210] Philippine citizens and holders of permanent resident visas were allowed in the country but subjected to a mandatory 14-day quarantine. The Philippine government also ordered a ban on travel to China, Hong Kong, and Macau until further notice.[211] On February 10, the ban was further extended to include Taiwan[212] but was lifted on February 15.[213] On February 14, the DOH announced that a risk assessment carried out to determine if Singapore would be placed under a travel ban.[214] Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced that he would not fully support any official travel bans to Singapore.[214] On February 26, travel to South Korea was banned, except for permanent residents, Filipino leaving for study, and Overseas Filipino Workers returning for work.[215]
The Philippine Ports Authority had barred disembarkation by crew or passengers from vessels which have recently visited China, and suspended the visitation privileges of relatives of Filipino seafarers and boarding privileges of non-government organizations providing emotional and spiritual support to seafarers.[216]
On March 19, Secretary Locsin announced that the Philippine government would deny the entry of all foreign nationals, effective that day ""until further notice"". All Philippine embassies and consulates would suspend the issuing of its visas to all foreign nationals and invalidate all existing ones. However, Locsin clarified that visas that had already been issued to families of Filipino nationals would still remain valid.[217]
Following the confirmation of the first localized transmission on March 7, the DOH raised its alert to Code Red Sub-Level 1.[218] Health Secretary Francisco Duque and Senator Bong Go, chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, recommended to President Duterte to declare a public health emergency in the country,[219] which would authorize local government units to employ their local disaster risk reduction management funds.[220] President Duterte issued Proclamation No. 922 on March 9, formally declaring a public health emergency.[12]
The Department of Trade and Industry on March 9 issued a directive ordering retailers should only allow the sale of two bottles of each type of disinfectant per person as a measure against hoarding. In line with the public health emergency declaration, the department imposed a 60-day price freeze on basic commodities.[221]
On March 16, the president signed Proclamation No. 929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the country for a period of six months, bringing into effect the following:[222]
The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) announced that it would provide ₱30-billion (US$581-million) worth of advance payment to its accredited health facilities in order for health care providers to obtain the liquid capital required to efficiently respond to the crisis. PhilHealth also subsided some of its policies on its members; it waived the 45-day coverage and single period of confinement policies, while extending payment deadlines until the end of April and the failing period of claims from 60 days to at least 120 days. In addition, PhilHealth announced that PUIs quarantined in its accredited facilities are entitled to a ₱14,000 ($270) health package, while those who tested positive for COVID-19 are entitled to a ₱32,000 ($580) beneficiary package.[224]
Following the sharp increase of confirmed cases, President Duterte called on Congress to hold special sessions on March 23 to enact the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act upon his request, which would ""authorize the President to exercise powers necessary to carry out urgent measures to meet the current national emergency related to COVID-19 only for three months, unless extended by Congress."" The act would allow President Duterte to ""reallocate, realign, and reprogram"" a budget of almost ₱275 billion ($5.37 billion) from the estimated ₱438 billion ($8.55 billion) national budget approved for 2020, in response to the pandemic;[225] enable him to ""temporarily take over or direct the operations"" of public utilities and privately owned health facilities and other necessary facilities ""when the public interest so requires"" for the purposes of quarantine, the accommodation of health professionals, and the distribution and storage of medical relief; and ""facilitate and streamline"" the accreditation of testing kits.[226]
In the Philippine House of Representatives, the bill was introduced as House Bill No. 6616 with House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of Pateros–Taguig as its principal sponsor and was defended on the floor by Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte of Camarines Sur's 2nd district. Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea addressed the session, stressing that the president needed ""standby powers"" to address the emergency.[227] Some representatives questioned the nature, usage, and necessity of the ""standby powers"", claiming its susceptibility to abuse and corruption.[228]
In the Senate of the Philippines, the bill was introduced as Senate Bill No. 1418 with Senate President Tito Sotto and Senator Pia Cayetano as its principal sponsors. Under the bill, Senator Cayetano said that over 18 million Filipino households living below the poverty line would also receive financial incentives of around ₱5,000–8,000 ($97.45–155.92) per month for two months.[229] Senators amended their version of the bill to include financial compensation of around ₱100,000 ($1,965.33) to be given by PhilHealth to health professionals who contracted the virus, as well as the provision of around ₱1 million-worth ($19,653.27) of financial aid to their families.[230]
Both versions of the bill reportedly removed the usage of the term ""emergency powers"", replacing it with ""authority"". It also removed the term ""take over of public utilities and private businesses"", limiting President Duterte's abilities at most to ""direct the operations"" of such enterprises.[231] The House version of the bill passed the House of Representatives in a 284–9 vote without abstentions,[232] while its Senate version unanimously passed the Senate.[233] President Duterte signed the bill into law the following day.[234]
Given the rapidly increasing number of cases in the National Capital Region, Albay 2nd district representative Joey Salceda proposed a week-long lockdown of the region in order to prevent the disease from spreading nationwide. Salceda specifically proposed the closure of the Philippine expressway network and public transportation accessing the region, in addition to the suspension of classes and work.[235] President Duterte initially rejected the proposal claiming it would ""hamper the flow of basic commodities"".[236] Secretary Duque, however, raised the possibility of a lockdown on certain cities or towns if cases of community-based transmissions are reported, but not an entire region.[237]
On March 12, President Duterte announced a partial lockdown covering Metro Manila,[98][99] that begun on March 15 and will last until April 14. Under the partial lockdown:
In addition, President Duterte advised local government units outside of the National Capital Region to implement a community quarantine in cases where, in a given level of local government, at least two COVID-19 cases are confirmed within a lower level of its jurisdiction; for example, a province-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two COVID-19 cases confirmed within different cities or municipalities in the same province, while a city/municipality-wide quarantine should be implemented if there are at least two COVID-19 cases confirmed within different barangays in the same city or municipality. Local government units were also authorized to utilize their quick response funds upon declaration of a state of emergency.[241]
Cainta also initiated a partial lockdown on March 15, after three cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the municipality.[242] Bohol Governor Arthur C. Yap announced that the province would be placed under community quarantine from March 16 to 20 and will prohibit tourists from entering during the quarantine period.[243]
On March 16, President Duterte imposed an ""enhanced"" community quarantine covering the entire Luzon, which entails the following measures:[244][245]
The Luzon measures also cover the Mimaropa region which includes the outlying islands of Palawan, Marinduque, Mindoro, and Romblon.[246]
On March 17, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles announced that the Office of the President, through the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, had rescinded the 72-hour window for which Overseas Filipinos and foreign nationals were allowed to depart the country from Luzon. As such, outbound passengers are permitted to depart the Philippines at any time during the period of the ""enhanced"" community quarantine, but Filipino residents are still prohibited from doing so.[247]
Vice President Leni Robredo's office raised ₱17.3 million ($261,360) to purchase around 36,000 sets of personal protective equipment (PPE) and donate it to about 2,400 frontline health professionals across the country. The first batch consisted of 7,350 PPEs that were donated to 490 professionals in eight hospitals in Manila and Quezon City with COVID-19 cases. Robredo said that her office is planning to donate around 29,000 more PPEs to different hospitals across the country.[248]
Local governments also took preventive measures against the pandemic. The local government of Sagada closed all government-managed tourist destinations in the municipality.[249] The local government of Samal has also barred all foreigners coming from countries affected by the coronavirus pandemic as well as all individuals suspected to have been infected wit the virus, and those who were previously quarantined from entering the island city.[250] Mayor Kit Nieto of Cainta, where the fifth case resided, ordered the immediate provision of face masks and disinfectants in areas near the residence of the patient. The patient's family, as well as his neighbors, were placed under quarantine.[251] Nieto suspended classes in Cainta from March 7 to 10.[252] On March 20, 2020, the local government of La Trinidad, Benguet began disinfection in the area, including the Halsema Highway.[253]
Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the provincial government of Bulacan suspended classes on Tuesday, March 10, 2020 as precaution.[254] Class suspensions were eventually extended up to Saturday, March 14.[255]

Although by 7 March some European politicians such as France's Marine Le Pen had called for Europe's internal borders to be temporarily closed,[297] the European Union by 13 March continued to reject the idea of suspending the Schengen free travel area and introducing border controls with Italy.[298][299][300][301] The deputy leader of the Swiss Ticino League, Lorenzo Quadri, by 29 February had criticised the decision: ""It is alarming that the dogma of wide-open borders is considered a priority.""[302] United States President Donald Trump said by 12 March the European Union had ""failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots"" as the US had implemented.[303]
By 9 March Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš stated that ""European countries cannot ban the entry of Italian citizens within the Schengen area. The only possible way is to have the Italian prime minister call on his fellow citizens to refrain from traveling to other countries of the European Union.""[304]
After Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Denmark announced complete closure of their national borders, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said by 12 March that ""Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization. Moreover, they have a strong social and economic impact, they disrupt people’s lives and business across the borders.""[305] European Union leaders condemned the US decision to restrict travel from Europe to the United States. European Council President Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen said in a joint statement: ""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the US decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.""[306] Ursula von der Leyen admitted by 17 March that ""all of us who are not experts initially underestimated the coronavirus.""[307]

Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity.""[313] Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said that ""European solidarity does not exist. That was a fairy tale.""[313]

The shortage of masks and other PPEs has caused many retailers to engage in profiteering by price gouging and scalping.[181] This included both local brick-and-mortar stores as well as retailers on ecommerce platforms.[181][248] The government has applauded platforms Carousell and Qoo10 for threatening to suspend profiteerers.[248] The governmental price controller has also issued warnings to retailers who engage in price gouging and requested information from e-commerce platforms on potential profiteers.[181][249][250]

A second wave of panic buying and hoarding occurred on 17 March when Malaysia announced its lockdown from 18 March, sparked by fears of food shortages. The government has clarified that the flow of goods, cargo and food supplies between Singapore and Malaysia will continue, urging the public not to panic buy. They added that Singapore has diverse sources of essential goods and was not facing an immediate shortage of food or essentials.[256] NTUC Fairprice has expanded its list of items that are limited per consumer to include eggs, vegetables and poultry.[257]
Several parties have engaged in scams related to the pandemic. For instance, scammers have pretended to be MOH officials engaging in contact tracing.[258] The MOH and police clarified that no financial details or transfer of money will be requested during contact tracing.[259] The police has also arrested scammers on ecommerce platform Carousell.[260]
Private-Hire Drivers and Taxi Drivers were hit by the impact of COVID-19. A S$77 million package was provided to help them tide through this period. In addition, a S$2.7 million fund was set up by the Government and National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) for drivers who are not eligible.
Various banks have suggested that Singapore Airlines will have a loss in FY21, with OCBC credit analysts Ezien Hoo and Wong Hong Wei arguing that the airline will have to tap the markets for more funds and possibly even need state support.[261]

On 17 February 2020, a leaked recording of a closed-door dialogue session on 10 February of Chan Chun Sing with business people from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) went viral in Singapore. In the leaked audio, Chan talked about the recent panic-buying of groceries, Singapore's approach to the current COVID-19 outbreak crisis, and why Singaporeans embarrassed themselves on the world stage with their actions that resulted in runs on supermarkets island-wide. There were two main reactions to this leaked recording in Singapore. Mainly, those who are in support of Chan's candidness and those who derided Chan for speaking in Singlish and belittling Singaporeans in the process. This was in response to Chan calling Singaporeans “idiots” for being part of the runs on supermarkets and causing undue panic. He also used the colloquial phrase for embarrassment, “sia suay“, to describe how he felt about regular Singaporeans and their actions that were seen throughout the rest of the world.[263] In response to the leak, SCCCI said that the leak is ""deeply disappointing"" and a ""betrayal of trust"", adding that it was investigating the source of the leak.[264]
While many international medical experts praised Singapore's efforts to control the outbreak in Singapore, The New York Times argued that this could well be the continuation of erosion of civil liberties.[265]

The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic spread to Namibia, with the first confirmed cases announced on 14 March 2020[1] by Namibian Minister of Health and Social Services Kalumbi Shangula.
On 14 March 2020 Namibia reported its first cases of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2. They were a Romanian couple who arrived in Windhoek from Spain via Doha, Qatar, on 11 March. They had been screened on arrival at Hosea Kutako International Airport but showed no symptoms at that time.[1] The couple recovered within 2 weeks.[2]
In a first reaction by government on the same day, air travel to and from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany was suspended for 30 days. All public and private schools were closed for a month, and large gatherings were prohibited. This includes celebrations for the 30th anniversary of Namibian independence that takes place on 21 March.[3] Libraries, museums, and art galleries were also closed.[1] President Hage Geingob declared a state of emergency as a legal basis to restrict fundamental rights, e.g. to freely move and assemble, guaranteed by the Constitution. The prohibition of large gatherings was clarified to apply to 50 or more people.[4]
On 19 March 2020 a third case was confirmed. A 61-year-old German citizen, who arrived in Namibia on 13 March, remains in isolation and is in stable condition. As with the Romanian couple, all contacts were followed up and tested. By 25 March 2020 the total number of cases reached seven, of which one is thought to be a local transmission. A 21-day lockdown of the regions of Erongo and Khomas was announced for 27 March with inter-regional travel forbidden, excluding the commuter towns of Okahandja and Rehoboth. Parliament sessions were suspended for the same period, and bars and markets were closed.[2]

On 14 March, after over 101 people have been diagnosed with coronavirus, Romania entered the third COVID-19 scenario.[31] The third scenario goes from 101 to 2,000 cases. In the third scenario the doctors will perform epidemiological screening in the tents installed in the hospitals' yards, and the hospitals of infectious diseases will treat only cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.[32] Likewise, the authorities will be able to impose quarantine at home, not just in hospitals, as in many areas the capacities of medical units could be exceeded.[33] At the same time, according to the plan in the third scenario, public gatherings with more than 50 people are banned.[34] Three more liberals have been diagnosed with COVID-19, all contacts of senator Vergil Chițac.[35] Marcel Ciolacu, President of the Chamber of Deputies, announced that the Parliament will suspend its activity for a week.

On 14 March, 18 days after the diagnosis of the first case of infection with SARS-CoV-2, Romania surpassed the threshold of 100 confirmed cases. 49% of those diagnosed were outside the country prior to diagnosis.[46] In 35% of cases, patients were previously in Italy, the country most affected by the pandemic in the European Union. These people were the main sources of transmission of the virus to the other 50%, in a single situation being unable to identify a suggestive epidemiological context for the diagnosed patient.[46] Two diagnosed people (cases #17 and #27) were responsible for infecting 22% of the number of patients.[46] This situation was possible because each of them hid from authorities, in the initial phase, the fact that they had previously travelled to an area at risk of infection, which delayed the initiation of the epidemiological investigation and exposed more people to the risk of infection. More than half of the cases (54%) were diagnosed in three counties: Bucharest, Timiș and Hunedoara.[46] A patient out of three was diagnosed in Bucharest. Few of the first 100 infected Romanian patients were older than 70, the age at which coronavirus often poses serious health problems, especially when the infected one also suffers from associated diseases. Basically, only six patients were over 70 years old.[46] Of the first 100 patients, only one case was serious, requiring ICU admission, while nine patients recovered, and 90 had mild to moderate symptoms.[46]

Cambodia ,"
The first case of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in Cambodia on 27 January 2020.[1]
Whether the Government has been trying to cover the facts or not since the very beginning, please ""consider and be wary"".  An unusual number of people publicly fainting, mostly in Phnom Penh, had risen within two months. These might/might not be just Syn⁠cope they presumed. This might/might not to put the blame on heat waves or triggering out of panic or fatigue. Not to mention some of them were apparently deceased. Therefore, DO NOT bet your entire trust in the Government. The situation could be much worse than what you grasped.At 3 p.m, the first case has been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family. Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital.[2][3][4]
After two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia. The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as him, most have since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remains under quarantine.[5][6]
The cruise ship MS Westerdam was reportedly taking 1,455 passengers and 802 crew around Asia, 651 of whom were U.S citizens. The ship was previously docked in Hong Kong, around the time it was badly hit by the virus.[7] The Westerdam arrived in Sihanoukville on 13 February after it had been turned away by four countries due to virus concerns. About 20 passengers on board, who were unwell, took clinical tests but the vast majority had their temperature taken and filled out a form. Most of these passengers then disembarked.
Of 145 passengers who was stopped in  Malaysia by plane on 15 February, a 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus, leading to concern that other passengers may also have been infected.[8] By only then, the remaining of 781 passengers were quarantined and taken clinical tests, and still the Westerdam was criticized as it was not designed for quarantine and the passengers were able to socialize.
A comedian based in Oregon who was hired to perform on the Westerdam, was said to have flouted the quarantine by sneaking a flight back to Seattle. However, he gave a quote that the quarantine never took place and he was cleared by US CDC on both ends.

Arkansas ,"This article details the viral pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the U.S. state of Arkansas. The first case in Arkansas was reported on March 11, 2020 in Pine Bluff, Jefferson County. As of March 24, 2020, the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) has confirmed 232 positive cases of coronavirus in the state, with two deaths and 10 recoveries. A total of 1,230 tests have been processed.[1]
On March 11, Governor Asa Hutchinson confirmed the state's first presumptive positive coronavirus case in Pine Bluff.[2]
On March 12, five more presumptive cases were reported, four of which had contact with the original Pine Bluff case, prompting the governor to order school closings in Grant, Jefferson, Pulaski, and Saline counties. Dr. Nathaniel (Nate) Smith, the Director and State Health Officer of the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH), said it was believed the original Pine Bluff case likely became infected in New Orleans during Mardi Gras.[3]
On March 13, Governor Hutchinson announced three more presumptive cases in the state, including the first instance of community spread. He recommended not to hold gatherings of more than 200 people in the counties with affected cases.[4]
On March 14, Governor Hutchinson announced three more presumptive positive cases, with all three cases being healthcare workers at Jefferson Regional Medical Center and related to the original Pine Bluff case.[5] He acknowledged that other Arkansans had probably contracted the disease, but they haven't been confirmed due to limited testing. During a press conference with the governor, the University of University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences chancellor, Cam Patterson, remarked that he hoped adding a new machine within a week would increase the ability for testing 160 tests per day compared to the current 20.[6] Before the end of the day, the Arkansas Department of Health's website had been updated to show that all presumptive positive cases were updated to confirmed cases.[7]
On March 15, Governor Hutchinson reported during a press conference that all public schools would close beginning Tuesday, March 17, with the option of closing Monday, March 16, if they were prepared. Schools would remain closed through spring break the following week. Earlier in the day, the Arkansas Department of Health's website was updated to show that there were 16 confirmed cases in the state.[8]
On March 16, Governor Hutchinson reported during a press conference in Fayetteville that the number of cases has risen to 22, with two of these in central Arkansas and two cases in Cleburne County, which were the result of out-of-state travel. He remarked that the testing capabilities of the state would be ramping up and that cases should be expected to rise along with more testing. He recommended that the number of people in events should be limited to 50, per CDC guidelines. He also discouraged unnecessary out-of-state travel.[9][10]
On March 17, Governor Hutchinson reported during a press conference in West Memphis that the number of cases remained at 22, but reiterated that confirmed cases are expected to rise as more tests occur in the coming days. He ordered all casinos closed for two weeks and said that for the next 30 days, the one-week waiting period and work reporting requirement to receive unemployment benefits had been waived.[11] The ADH's website was updated with a map that showed the virus was now present in Cleveland, Desha, and Lincoln counties.[1]
On March 18, Governor Hutchinson said the state was working to allocate $12 million in federal Community Development Block Grant funds, aiming to target hospitals and other businesses essential to the coronavirus response. Additionally, he said he would allocate $4 million from the state's Quick Action Closing Fund which would provide loans of up to $250,000 to help businesses make payroll and stay open. The state also requested a disaster declaration from the Small Business Administration which would help provide loans of up to $2 million to provide capital for businesses. The state is also relaxing SNAP work requirements through May.[12][13] The ADH's website updated their county map to show Bradley, Faulker, and Washington counties had confirmed cases.[1]
On March 19, Governor Hutchinson reported during his daily press conference an increase to 62 confirmed cases, many from community spread. This prompted him to institute measures to try to help mitigate further spread. He announced public schools would remain closed through April 17; restaurants and bars would not be allowed to provide dine-in services but could still provide carryout, curbside pickup, or delivery, beginning Friday, March 20; state government employees would begin working from home; healthcare providers would begin screening all visitors and staff for fever and symptoms; and indoor venues such as gyms would be closed to visitors.[14] The ADH's website updated their county map to show Clark, Craighead, Grant, Independence, Poinsett, Pope, Searcy, Sevier, and Van Buren counties had confirmed cases.[1]
On March 20, Governor Hutchinson reported during his press conference that the number of cases at that time were up to 96. Thirteen of these new cases were connected to a nursing home in Little Rock where four staff and nine residents tested positive. Dr. Nate Smith added that of the 96 cases, 26 were people over the age of 65, 62 were between ages 19 and 64, and eight were children. Education Secretary Johnny Key said that the state would apply for a federal government waiver to standardized testing requirements. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said an additional $3 million would be added to the loan program for small businesses that the governor announced on March 18.[15] Col. John Schuette, installation commander of the Little Rock Air Force Base, announced that an active-duty U.S. Air Force airman assigned to the base tested positive. A 30-day public health emergency for the base was declared.[16] The ADH's website updated their county map to show Benton, Boone, Crittenden, 
Greene, and Polk counties had confirmed cases.[1]
On March 21, Governor Hutchinson reported an increase in the number of cases to 118.

On March 22, Governor Hutchinson reported an increase in the number of cases to 165. Forty-one of the total cases came from a nursing home in Little Rock. Hutchinson said the state was having a hard tough securing personal protective equipment (PPE). Arkansas received 25 percent of the PPE the state requested from the federal government's national storehouse. He estimated that 8,000 to 10,000 Arkansans had filed for unemployment in the previous week. Due to such a high number of claims, Hutchinson said he would ask the Arkansas General Assembly to approve $1.1 million from his rainy day fund for upgrades to the unemployment system. Secretary of Commerce Mike Preston said the Arkansas Economic Development Commission had received around 300 calls and emails inquiring about the business loans the governor had outlined earlier in the week.[18][19] The ADH's website updated their county map to show Columbia, Conway, Union, and Woodruff counties had confirmed cases.[1]

The first death in the state was reported on March 24, a 91-year-old male from Faulkner County.[22] In his daily press conference, Governor Hutchinson reported that a second death had also occurred, a person in his or her 50s. Hutchinson reaffirmed that he did not want to issue a shelter-in-place order like other states had despite saying the state was still in the beginning stages of its outbreak. Both Hutchinson and Dr. Nate Smith remarked that April 12 would be too early for the state to return to normal operations, which is the date President Trump had targeted during an interview earlier in the day.[23] The ADH's website updated their county map to show Cross, Hempstead, Hot Spring and Pike counties had confirmed cases.[1]

Germany ,"

The 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have been transmitted to Germany on 27 January 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed and contained near Munich, Bavaria. The majority of the COVID-19 cases in January and early February originated from the headquarters of a car parts manufacturer there. Later, new clusters were introduced by travellers from Italy, China and Iran, from where passenger flights were stopped on 18 March. On 25 and 26 February, following the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, multiple cases related to the Italian outbreak were detected in Baden-Württemberg. Other cases, which were not related to the Italian clusters, occurred in multiple regions including Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate. A specific cluster formed in Heinsberg was linked to the Carnival in Gangelt.[4] Currently, the largest number of COVID-19 cases in Germany are in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.[5] The first deaths, a 89-year-old woman in Essen and a 78-year-old man in Heinsberg, were reported on 9 March.[6][7]
German disease and epidemic control is advised by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) according to a national pandemic plan. The outbreaks were first managed in a containment stage (with the first measures of the protection stage),[8] which attempted to minimise the expansion of clusters. The German government and several health officials stated that the country was well prepared and at first saw no need in taking special measures to stock up or to limit public freedom. Since 13 March, the pandemic has been managed in the protection stage with German states mandating school and kindergarten closures, postponing academic semesters and prohibiting visits to nursing homes to protect the elderly. Two days later, borders to neighboring countries were closed. On 22 March, the government announced a national curfew, almost identical to Austria and Bavaria, where it had been implemented seven days and three days before respectively. Individuals are only allowed to leave their living quarters for certain activities e.g. commuting to work, doing sports or for groceries, and not in groups of more than two people if they do not share the same household.
As of 24 March 2020,[update] a project by Funke Mediengruppe, which attempts to summarize data early from German health departments, the Johns Hopkins University and the Robert Koch Institute, has reported 32,986 cases, 172 deaths and 3,243 recoveries.[9] The relatively low death rate in comparison to several other European countries has led to various theories. The head of Robert Koch Institute warned that the death rate would increase and become similar to other countries.
On 25 February, a 25-year-old man from Göppingen, Baden-Württemberg, who had recently returned from Milan, Italy, tested positive and was treated in Klinik am Eichert.[10] On 26 February, Baden-Württemberg confirmed three new cases.

Germany has a common National Pandemic Plan,[8] which describes the responsibilities and measures of the health care system actors in case of a huge epidemic. Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.[71] Four major targets are included in this plan:
The plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:
In the containment stage health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the protection stage the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The mitigation stage will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.
The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online. For Germany, the cases are also broken down by state. The data was published daily at 10:00 prior to 1 March 2020. Between 1 March 2020 and 9 March 2020, RKI reported cases at 10:00 and at 15:00. Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted. New numbers were published once a day in the afternoon. Starting 17 March 2020, new numbers are published at midnight (0:00) for the previous day.
As of March 2020, the reported death rate in Germany was lower than, for example, the Italian one. This has led foreign media to applaud or question it, while virologists, among others the leader of the RKI, warn that the country was simply at an earlier stage of the outbreak and fatalities would soon increase.[72][73][74][75] Different theories exist:
On 22 January 2020, the German government considered the spread of COVID-19 as a ""very low health risk"" for Germans and the virus in general as ""far less dangerous"" than SARS. New travel advisories would not be necessary.[77]
On 27 January, after the first infections in Germany, the government continued to regard the probability of a spread as ""very low"". Even if individual cases emerged, authorities would be able to treat them.[78]
At a press conference on 28 January, the Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn, stated that he was worrying only about conspiracy theories which circulated on the internet, and said that the Federal Government would counter this problem through full transparency. Hotlines were established to calm down worried callers. After a case was suspected in a Lufthansa plane, the company suspended all flights to China.[79][80]
On 29 January, reports surged that masks were sold out. The government ordered pilots of flights from China to describe the health status of their passengers and ordered passengers to fill out a contact document. The government and health authorities expected more isolated cases but were confident to prevent further spread.[79][80]
On 30 January, on national television a virologist referred to the government calling the flu wave of 2018 more dangerous than coronavirus as negligent and downplaying.[81]
On 1 of February 2020, German Health Minister Spahn warned that people infected with the Coronavirus and their contacts might be stigmatised and be socially excluded. He emphasised that the Germans evacuated from China would all be healthy.[82]
On 13 February 2020, at a meeting of EU Health Ministers, German Health Minister Spahn dismissed travel restrictions from or to China by single member states. He decidedly rejected measuring the temperature of inbound travelers.[83]
On 24 February, the Light + Building Trade Fair in Frankfurt was postponed until September.[84]
On 25 February, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Tod D. Wolters, was asked by senators if there were plans for restricting U.S. troop travel to other countries apart from Italy. He pointed to Germany as a potential candidate.[85] AfD politician Alice Weidel demanded closing borders in Europe.[86]
On 26 February, following the confirmation of multiple COVID-19 cases in North Rhine-Westphalia, Heinsberg initiated closure of schools, swimming pools, libraries and the town hall until 2 March. Games and training for FC Wegberg-Beeck were suspended.[87][88] The international German Open Badminton in Mülheim was cancelled.[89] The Cologne-Wahn military airport was temporarily closed.[90][91] The German government opted not to implement travel restrictions on Italy over the coronavirus outbreak there.[92] It also considered itself ""far from"" issuing a travel warning for the country,[93] which would have enabled free cancellation of trips.[94]
On 28 February, Germany first entered the top ten of countries that had the highest number of coronavirus infections as number nine, in Europe second only to Italy.[92] ITB Berlin was cancelled by its organisers.[95] Heinsberg extended closure of daycare facilities and schools to 6 March. The officials imposed a 14-day home isolation for people who had had direct contacts with individuals in the current cases as well as people who showed flu symptoms.[96] Lufthansa cut the number of short- and medium-haul flights by up to 25%, and removed multiple long-haul routes resulting in 23 long-haul aircraft being taken out of operation.[97] On the same day, Germany enacted new health security measures to include regulations for air and sea travel, requiring passengers from China, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran to report their health status before entry. Train railway companies must report passengers with symptoms to authorities and the federal police would step up checks within 30 kilometres of the border.[98] The government also declared it would prepare a central acquisition of protection masks and suits to create a reserve, that not all events should be cancelled and that its crisis team would from then on meet twice a week.[99]
On 29 February, it was reported that supermarket chains had seen an increase in demand, particularly for tinned food, noodles, disinfectants and toilet paper, which according to a local source had started on 27 February.[100][101] The State Minister of Consumer Protection in North Rhine-Westphalia critized panic buying as being entirely inappropriate and needlessly creating panic.[101] On 28 February, after recent drastic price hikes and shortages especially of masks, medications and disinfectants which were the result of a steep increase in demand, calls were made to consumers to leave those products for hospitals and medical practices.[102]
On 1 March, the number of confirmed infections almost doubled within one day. German Interior Minister, Horst Seehofer, expressed his optimism that a vaccine would be available by the end of the year. The Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, said the government was prepared for a stimulus package to mitigate the economical impact. The Health Minister, Jens Spahn, recommended that people with symptoms of a cold should avoid mass events.[103]
On 2 March, the German Robert Koch Institute raised its threat level for Germany to ""moderate"" and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control raised its threat level for Europe from ""moderate"" to ""high"". The German Health Minister dismissed the closure of borders or companies or ending large events or direct flights between China and Germany as unnecessary or inappropriate.[104] Germany sent lab equipment, protection suits, and gloves for the coronavirus in Iran.[105]
On 3 March, the German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, the Bavarian State Chamber of Medicine, the Bavarian Association of Paediatricians, and the Association of General Practitioners of Berlin and Brandenburg reported a lack of protection gear to handle COVID-19 cases.[106][107][108] The Leipzig Book Fair cancelled the exhibition planned for mid-March.[109] Markus Söder, Minister President of Bavaria and leader of the CSU, and the German Minister for Economics, Peter Altmaier, pushed for financial help for companies affected by the virus.[110][111]
On 4 March, the crisis team considered the acquisition of more protection gear as an ""extraordinary urgency"". Germany prohibited the export of protection masks, gloves, and suits. North Rhine-Westphalia declared to order one million masks.[112] A parliamentary discussion took place. The Health Minister, Spahn, warned that the consequences of fear could be far worse than the virus itself. Spokespersons of Greens and FDP praised the government for its management of the crisis. AfD-leader Weidel disagreed and also proposed measuring fever at airports. SPD health policymaker Bärbel Bas said measuring fever made no sense because not all infected had it.[113] Israel ordered a 14-day quarantine for all travellers from Germany and four other European countries.[114]
On 5 March, the German Federal Office for Citizen Protection and Disaster Support (BBK) said that the spread in Germany was ""no catastrophe"" and that citizens should prepare for real catastrophes instead. The leader of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom, expressed his concern that some countries showed an unwillingness to act or gave up. He admonished all countries to raise their commitment to the level of the threat.[115]
On 6 March, the German Health Minister Spahn ruled out ""any measure leading to restrictions on travel"" within the European Union and spoke out against closing all schools and universities in Germany. Spahn recommended not to make unnecessary travels and suggested people coming from risk areas should stay at home. Spahn participated in a meeting with the other European Health Ministers to discuss the crisis. The EU and Robert Koch Institute emphasised that masks and disinfectants should not be used by healthy private persons.[116][117]
On 8 March, the German Health Minister recommended cancelling events with more than 1000 attendees for the time being. The Deutsche Fußball Liga announced to continue the season of its soccer leagues until its regular end in mid-May.[118] Poland announced random temperature checks for bus passengers from Germany near a border crossing starting the next day.[119]
On 9 March, Germany reported the first deaths. The number of COVID-19 infections nearly doubled to more than 1,200 within the last few days, which put pressure on the government to act. Angela Merkel's administration announced measures to cushion the economic blow.[120] Merkel, who had publicly kept a low profile regarding the outbreak, emphasised it was important to slow down the spread and buy time. The government's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said citizens could be ""confident that the whole Federal Government, with the Chancellor at the helm, is doing everything possible to contain the spread of this virus.""[121] The Health Minister put emphasis on the responsibility of each individual to slow down the spread and ruled out preemptively closing daycare centres or schools.[122]
On 10 March, Chancellor Merkel announced that between 60-70% of Germans would get the virus, an estimate already made 9 days earlier by the head virologist of the Charité, Christian Drosten.[123][124] In reaction to a general ban on events with more than 1,000 participants put into immediate effect by several federal states, Germany's Ice Hockey league DEL announced that the 2019/2020 season would be cancelled immediately, and that the championship title would remain vacant this season.[125]  Several matches of the soccer leagues, including Bundesliga derbies would be played behind closed doors, a first in the 57-year history of the Bundesliga.[126] Berlin mayor Michael Müller (SPD) disagreed and said that mass events should not be cancelled preemptively and expected the sold-out soccer match between Union Berlin and FC Bayern Munich on March 14 not to be behind closed doors.[127]
On 11 March, having faced accusations over inaction the previous days, Merkel took the unusual step of dedicating an entire press conference on the single topic of the COVID-19 crisis. She emphasised at the conference: ""We will do the necessary, as a country and in the European Union"".[128] She announced liquidity support for companies, especially via the German development bank KfW, to be realised before the week was over. She insisted again on not closing borders. Merkel recommended everyone avoid shaking hands, for example by looking a second longer and smiling instead. The German health minister added that mouth protection and disinfectants were needless for individuals and that it was enough to wash hands with soap intensively.[129] With the FDP politician Hagen Reinhold, a member of the Bundestag has been tested positive for the first time.[130] A staff member of the German ministry of justice has also contracted the virus. Several members of the Bundestag for the Social Democratic Party of Germany were placed under quarantine, including the epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach.[131] US President Trump announced a 30-day travel ban to the US for foreigners that travelled to from Schengen area states, including Germany, effective 13 March 23:59 EDT.[132][133]
On 12 March, German foreign politicians were caught by surprise by a travel ban by the United States and criticised the fact it was not coordinated with them. They also complained that the United Kingdom was not included.[134] Although the neighbouring countries have already closed their schools, the German minister of education, Anja Karliczek, declared that a nationwide closure of schools was not yet under debate. The Kultusministerkonferenz debated whether the virus could threaten the upcoming school-leaving examination, Abitur. Its director, Stefanie Hubig, decided that the oral examinations in Rhineland-Palatinate between 16 and 25 March would take place according to plan. She also recommended cancelling class trips to risk areas.[135]
On 13 March, 14 of the 16 German federal states decided to close their schools and nurseries for the next few weeks. Germany's neighbours Czech Republic, Poland and Denmark closed their borders.[136] Germany rushed to order 10,000 ventilators from Drägerwerk for intensive respiratory care, twice the order size of Italy and equivalent to the production of a whole year. Ventilators are increasingly short in supply for being vital to supply breathable air to the lungs of intensive care patients with COVID-19, whose regular breathing is impeded by pneumonia.[137] Germany entered talks for softening its export stop of protective gear for other European Union states.[138] The government decided to give financial support to artists, private cultural institutions and event companies that struggle in the crisis.[139] Scholz and Altmeier also assured unlimited credits to all companies of any size.[140] Bundesliga announced that all soccer matches would be postponed until at least 2 April.[141]
On 14 March, several federal states widened their measures to limit public activities. For example, Berlin, Schleswig-Holstein and Saarland closed bars among other leisure venues. Cologne forbid all events in the city centre. Shops noted a great increase in demand for provisions and sanitary products.[142] An FDP member of Bundestag, Thomas Sattelberger, went public that he was also infected as he criticised on Twitter a video created by Germany's largest public broadcaster, ARD.[143] The video presented COVID-19 as a justified reflex of nature by particularly killing the old as well as people in the developed world, who it suggested ruined the planet with global warming and turbocapitalism, so that this way there would be less pollution and overpopulation. The authors of the much-criticized[144] video later apologised for hurting feelings and stressed that it was a satire with the stylistic element of exaggeration while standing behind their work.[145][143]
On 15 March, local elections in Bavaria took place amid the crisis. Many election workers dropped out so that the elections were ""acutely threatened"" and teachers had to be conscripted on one day's notice.[146] German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer announced to shut down the borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark and Luxembourg. The measure would begin on Monday and the transportation of goods and commuters would be exempt.[147] Deutsche Bahn decided to reduce its regional traffic and, to protect its staff, suspended further ticket inspections.[148]
On 16 March, the state of Bavaria declared a state of emergency for 14 days and introduced measures to limit public movement and provide additional funds for medicine supplies. Bavarian minister president Markus Söder ordered closures of all sports and leisure facilities starting on 17 March. Restaurants were ordered to limit their dine-in opening hours to before 3:00PM; to ensure a minimum distance of 1.5 metres between guests; and to accommodate a maximum of 30 guests. Supermarkets, chemist's shops, banks, pet shops, and all business that sell essential basic needs are allowed extended opening times including on Sundays, while non-essential shops are to be closed at all times.[149] After public outrage over flights from Iran still landing in Germany without tests or quarantine, the German Ministry of Transport stopped all flights from Iran and China.[150][151] Italian scientists, including virologist Roberto Burioni, warned Germany against underestimating the danger and the director of Eurac Research said Germany needed a lockdown or the numbers would go out of control.[152] In the evening, Merkel announced measures similar to Bavaria for the entire country, agreed on by all federal states and the ruling coalition. This also includes a prohibition on travelling in coaches, attending religious meetings, visiting playgrounds or engaging in tourism.[153] The government stressed it was no ""shutdown"".[154]
On 17 March, the Robert Koch Institute raised the health threat risk for COVID-19 in Germany to ""high"". Limits on the testing capacity and a delay of 3–4 days meant that reported numbers were significantly lower than the actual ones.[155] Employment agencies and job centres reported a tenfold increase in calls and had to relax sanctions.[156] Berlin announced the plan to construct a hospital with the Bundeswehr for housing 1000 beds for COVID-19 patients. The Federal and State Governments agreed on a new emergency plan for German hospitals which includes doubling the current capacity of 28,000 intensive care beds, of which 25,000 are equipped with ventilation.[157] After a man tested positive in an asylum seeker centre in Suhl, a quarantine led to days of protest, physical resistance and escape attempts over fences or the sewage system. In an SEK operation with protection suits and tanks, 200 police forces calmed the situation and relocated 17 offenders.[158][159] The Interior Minister of Lower Saxony warned that untrue news could trigger panic buying and conflicts, and demanded laws to punish publishing wrong information regarding the supply situation, including the medical one, or aspects of the virus.[160] In the evening, Merkel announced that she and other EU leaders had decided on an immediate travel ban into the European Union for 30 days for non-EU citizens. She also said the European Commission began to start a collective tender for medical gear.[161]
On 18 March, Germany widened its travel restrictions to EU citizens from Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Luxembourg and Spain, who had up to that time been able to arrive by flight or ship.[162] Germany still received flights from Iran and China due to bilateral agreements, although the German ministry of transportation had said two days earlier it would forbid passenger flights from there. The passengers were not tested for the virus and their temperatures were not taken due to the absence of administrative 
orders.[163] The head of the Robert Koch Institute warned that the number of infected could rise to up to ten million in two months unless social contacts were reduced significantly, and called for a minimum distance of 1.5 metres to be maintained in all direct contact. The government began to bring back thousands of German travelers stranded in non-EU countries with charter flights. The public health insurance companies assured to cover all expenses related to the crisis with no limitation.[162]
On 19 March, discussions of the prime ministers and Merkel regarding a curfew were considered for 22 of March.[164] A German manufacturer of breathing masks for hospitals and doctors complained that his warnings in early February that masks were selling out and his offer to reserve masks for hopsitals had remained unanswered by the health ministry. The ministry explained to the press that they had received the messages but deemed itself not responsible and that the numerous offers could not be replied to due to prioritization. Some hospitals reported they were already facing shortages of protective gears.[165]
A survey revealed that more than 80% of the doctors in private practice reported a lack of protective equipment.[166] Car manufacturers announced to donate several hundred thousand masks to hospitals, doctors and health authorities. Daimler donated 110,000 masks of their pandemic protection reserve and BMW donated 100,000 breathing masks. Volkswagen announced to donate 200,000 masks of FFP-2 and FFP-3 categories and looked into manufacturing parts for medical equipment.[167]
On 20 March, Bavaria was the first state to declare a curfew, inspired by and identical to Austria,[168] where it had been implemented four days before.[169] The Bavarian curfew would begin at midnight and fine violators up to €25,000. It would remain permitted to go to work as well as to supermarkets, medics and pharmacies, under the condition that the trip is solitary or with housemates. Under the same condition, it is also permitted to do sports outside; to visit the life partner or aged, sick or disabled people that do not live in a facility; and to help others in general or provide for animals. Restaurants except drive-ins and for take-away, DIY shops and hairdressers would be shut down.[170][171] The Federal government scheduled a discussion for 22 March to decide on a nationwide curfew and still faced opposition from the German Association of Towns and Municipalities and reservations, among others from the Governing Mayor of Berlin, Michael Müller, or Minister President of Thuringia, Bodo Ramelow.[172]
Annalena Baerbock, chairwoman of the Greens, criticised Bavaria's introduction of the curfew as counter-productive, saying that there should not be a competition of which federal state is the fastest and strictest and that there would already be a round of voting on this question with all the federal states and the Chancellor in two days.[173] Starting also at midnight, the state of Saarland, a region close France's badly affected Grand Est region, also put a similar curfew into place.[174] Lufthansa donated 920,000 breathing masks to the health authorities.[175]
On 21 March, after more and more residents of asylum centres tested positive for the virus, asylum seekers were unsettled. In Suhl, some threw stones at the police, threatened to set the residence on fire, and used children as human shields. Refugee organisations demanded smaller residencies, including accommodation in hotels and hostels.[176]
The government drafted a change to the German Protection against Infection Act to allow the federal government more power over the federal states. Among others it would allow the health ministry to prohibit border crossings, track the contacts of infected persons and enlist doctors, medicine students and other health care workers in the efforts against an infectious disease.[177]
On 22 March, the government and the federal states agreed for at least two weeks to forbid gatherings of more than two people and require a minimum distance of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) between people in public except for families, partners or people living in the same household. Restaurants and services like hairdressers were to be closed.[178] 
Individual states and districts were allowed to impose stricter measures than these. Saxony joined
Bavaria and the Saarland in prohibiting residents from leaving their dwellings except for good reasons,
which are similar to the ones in the other two states; outdoor exercise is permitted under the new rules
only alone or in groups of maximal five members of the same household.[179]
Chancellor Merkel got under quarantine because a physician tested positive who had vaccinated her two days earlier.[180] Volkswagen, bought for millions of Euros medical equipment in China in order to donate it to Germany and also intends to produce masks.[181]
On 23 March, the government decided on a financial aid package totaling around 750 billion Euros to mitigate the damage of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy with Germany planning to take on new debt for the first time since 2013.[182]
Stephan Pusch, the District Administrator of Heinsberg, asked the Chinese president for help with protective equipment, because the reserve of masks and protective gowns would only last a few more days.[183] Hospitals and doctors urged the government again to address the lack of masks and other protection gear. Berlin received 8000 masks from the nation's central provisioning, which would only mean one mask for every doctor's practice.[184] Of the ten million masks promised by the health minister Spahn, only 150,000 had arrived so far.[185] A transport plane arrived with masks and coronavirus test kits donated by Alibaba. Other Chinese tech companies like Oppo and Xiaomi also donated masks.[186] Beiersdorf delivered 6000 liters of disinfectants as part of a larger donation of 500 tons.[187]
On 24 March, a delivery of 6 million protective masks of type FFP-2, which filter 90% of particles, ordered by the German central provisioning to protect health workers was reported missing at an airport in Kenya.[188] They had been produced by a German company and it was unclear why they had been in Kenya.[189]

The initial response of the Japanese government to the COVID-19 outbreak was a policy of containment that focused on the repatriation of Japanese citizens from Wuhan, the point of origin of the pandemic, and the introduction of new border control regulations.
On 24 January, PM Abe convened the ""Ministerial Meeting on Countermeasures Related to the Novel Coronavirus"" at the Prime Minister's Office with members of his Cabinet in response to a statement released by the World Health Organization (WHO) that morning which confirmed human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus.  Abe announced that he would introduce appropriate countermeasures to the disease in coordination with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).[42]
On 28 January, PM Abe designated the new coronavirus as an ""infectious disease"" under the Infectious Diseases Control Law (Japanese: 感染症の予防及び感染症の患者に対する医療に関する法律), which allows the government to order patients with COVID-19 to undergo hospitalization.  He also designed the disease as a ""quarantinable infectious disease"" under the Quarantine Act, which allows the government to quarantine people suspected of infection and order them to undergo diagnosis and treatment.[43]
On 30 January, PM Abe announced the establishment of the ""Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters"" (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策本部), which meets at the Prime Minister's Office and is run by a task force led by Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary for Crisis Management Okita Yoshiki.[44][45] The initial roster of the task force includes 36 high-ranking bureaucrats from several of the Ministries of Japan to coordinate government response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Headquarters acts as the site of PM Abe's decision-making process on the country's virus countermeasures.

After the COVID-19 outbreak on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, the Japanese government shifted its focus from a containment policy to a prevention and treatment one because it anticipated rising numbers of community spreads within Japan. This policy prioritized the creation of a COVID-19 testing and consultation system based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the government's existing 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that is separate from the civilian hospital system.  The new system handles the transfer of COVID-19 patients to mainstream medical facilities to facilitate patient flow, triage, and the management of limited testing kits on their behalf to prevent a rush of infected and uninfected patients from overwhelming healthcare providers and transmitting diseases to them.  By regulating COVID-19 testing at the national level, the Abe Administration integrated the activities of the national government, the local governments, medical professionals, business operators, and the public in treating the disease.

Without any uniform diagnosis kit for the disease, the government has relied on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to check for infections. As few mainstream medical facilities in Japan had the ability to conduct PCR tests, Abe also promised to increase the number of institutions with such kits, including universities and private companies [51]
On 12 February, PM Abe announced during the Seventh Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Headquarters that the government would expand the scope of COVID-19 testing to include patients with symptoms based on the discretion of local governments.  Previously, testing was restricted to those with a history of travelling to Hubei Province.[52][53]　On the same day, the Ministry of Health and NIID also contracted SRL Inc to handle PCR clinical laboratory testing.[54]  Since then, the government has partnered with several more private companies to expand laboratory testing capabilities and to work towards the development of a rapid testing kit.[55]

The general public needs to contact a consultation centre by phone to get tested at one of the government's specialized outpatient wards (Japanese: 帰国者・接触者外来).[56][57]
On 16 February, PM Abe convened the government's first Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策専門家会議) at the Prime Minister's Office to draft national guidelines for COVID-19 testing and treatment.[58]  The meeting was chaired by Dr. Wakita Takaji, Director of the NIID, who brought together ten public health experts and medical professionals from across Japan to coordinate a response to the virus with PM Abe and the government's coronavirus task force in a roundtable format. The main concern of the Japanese medical establishment was an overcrowding of hospitals by uninfected patients with light cold symptoms who believed that they had COVID-19. Medical representatives claimed that such a panic would strain medical resources and risk exposing those uninfected patients to the disease itself.[59][60]
On 17 February, the Ministry of Health released its consultation guidelines (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症についての相談・受診の目安について) to each of the municipal and prefectural governments and their public health centers.[61] The document instructs doctors and public health nurses who staff the consultation centres to limit consultations to people with the following conditions: (1) cold symptoms and a fever of at least 37.5 Celsius for over four days while taking antipyretic medication; and (2) extreme fatigue and breathing difficulties.  The elderly, people with pre-existing conditions, and pregnant women with cold symptoms can receive consultation if they have had them for two days.  The guidelines also note that people who are dissatisfied with their consultation results can visit one of the specialized outpatient wards (帰国者・接触者外来) for further talks.
On 25 February, the Abe Administration introduced the ""Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control"" (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策の基本方針) to act as the government's uniform basic policy on COVID-19 control.[62]  After a spike of infections in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, PM Abe decided that the government's disease countermeasures would prioritize the prevention of large-scale clusters in Japan. This includes the government's controversial requests to suspend such large-scale gatherings as community events and school operations, as well as its policy to limit patients with light cold symptoms from visiting medical facilities to prevent them from overwhelming hospital resources.[63]
On 23 February, PM Abe instructed the government's coronavirus task force to quickly draft a comprehensive basic policy.[64] Health Minister Katsunobu Kato reconvened the medical experts from the first Novel Coronavirus Expert Meeting on 24 February to draft this policy.[65]   During the meeting, the medical establishment presented its policy recommendations in the form of a views report  (Japanese: 新型コロナウイルス感染症対策の基本方針の具体化に向けた見解), concluding that the most important objective of PM Abe's basic policy must be the prevention of large-scale disease clusters and a decrease in the outbreak and death of patients with severe symptoms. They stated that it is not possible for the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Japan on a person-to-person basis, but that there is a possibility that it can regulate the overall speed of infection.[66]  They cited the next week or two as a ""critical moment"" on whether the country would experience a large cluster that could result in the collapse of the medical system and socio-economic chaos.  After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.  Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to ""chaos,"" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the Diamond Princess. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into ""breeding grounds"" of COVID-19.[67]
On 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the ""Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control"" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.
First, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions – to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.[67]
Second, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.
Third, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.
On 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.[68]
On 27 February, the Japanese government also announced plans to expand the national health insurance system so that it covers COVID-19 tests.[69]
On 9 March, the Ministry of Health reconvened the Expert Meeting after the two week ""critical moment.""  The panel of medical experts concluded that Japan was currently not on track to experience a large-scale cluster, but stated that there is a two-week time lag in analysing COVID-19 trends and that the country would continue to see more infections.   Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters.  With more COVID-19 outbreaks around the world, the panel also proposed that new infections from abroad could initiate a ""second wave"" of the disease in Japan.[70][71]
On 9 March, the Health Ministry published a disease forecast of each prefecture and instructed their local governments to prepare their hospitals to accommodate its patient estimates.  It predicts that the virus peak of each prefecture will occur three months after their first reported case of local transmission.  The Ministry estimates that during its peak, Tokyo will see 45,400 outpatients and 20,500 inpatients per day, of whom 700 will be in severe condition.  For Hokkaido, the figure is 18,300 outpatients and 10,200 inpatients daily, of whom about 340 will be in severe condition.[72]
On 25 February, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare established a ""Cluster Response Section"" (Japanese: クラスター対策班) in accordance to the Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control.[73]  The purpose of the new section is to quickly identify and contain small-scale clusters of COVID-19 infections before they turn into large-scale ones.  It is led by university professors Oshitani Hitoshi and Nishiura Hitoshi and consists of a contact trace team and a surveillance team from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), a data analysis team from Hokkaido University, a risk management team from Tohoku University, and an administration team.[74]  Whenever a local government determines the existence of a cluster from hospital reports, the Ministry of Health dispatches the Section to that area to conduct an epidemiological survey and contact tracing. After the teams determine the original source of infection, the Ministry and local government officials enact countermeasures to locate, test, and place under medical surveillance anybody who may have come into contact with an infected person. They can also file requests to suspend infected businesses or restrict events from taking place there.
On 15 March, the Ministry of Health reported fifteen COVID-19 clusters in Japan.[75]  The largest cluster involves more than 80 people across four live music clubs in Osaka from concerts held in mid-February.[76] Another cluster of 50 people occurred at an elderly day care centre in Nagoya in early March, which resulted in 12 deaths.[77]
To provide a stronger legal basis for its COVID-19 countermeasures, the Abe Administration has proposed an amendment to the ""Special Measures Act to Counter New Types of Influenza of 2012"" that will allow it to declare a ""state of emergency"" and mandate the prohibition of large-scale gatherings and the movement of people during a disease outbreak.  Currently, school closures and event cancellations are voluntary responses by the public and local governments.
On 5 February 2020, the Abe Administration's coronavirus task force initiated political debate on the introduction of emergency measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak a day after the British cruise ship Diamond Princess was asked to quarantine.  Initial debate focused on constitutional reform due to the task force's apprehension that the Japanese Constitution may restrict the government's ability to enact such compulsory measures as quarantines on the grounds that it violated human rights.  After lawmakers representing almost all of the major political parties – including the Liberal Democratic Party, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and Democratic Party for the People – voiced their strong opposition towards this proposal and asserted that the Constitution allowed for emergency measures, the Abe Administration moved forward with legislative reform instead.[78]
On 5 March 2020, Prime Minister Abe introduced a draft amendment to the ""Special Measures Act to Counter New Types of Influenza of 2012"".  He met separately with the heads of five opposition parties on 4 March to promote a ""united front"" in passing the reforms.  The new law would allow the national and prefectural governors to instruct residents to avoid unnecessary outings and to close such facilities as schools, day care centres, and social welfare facilities for the elderly. To allay the concerns of the opposition parties, Abe said he would include a two-year limit on the power to declare a state of emergency.[79]
The Abe Administration plans to submit the revision bill to the National Diet on 10 March, and has coordinated with the opposition parties to have it passed by the Lower House on 12 March, and the Upper House on 13 March.[80]
On 12 February, PM Abe announced during the Eighth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government would secure a total of 500 billion yen for emergency lending and loan guarantees to small and medium enterprises affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.[81] He also declared that his Cabinet would set aside 15.3 billion yen from contingency funds to facilitate the donation of isolated virus samples to relevant research institutions across the globe.
On 1 March, PM Abe evoked the Act on Emergency Measures for Stabilizing Living Conditions of the Public to regulate the sale and distribution of facial masks in Hokkaido.  Under this policy, the Japanese government instructed manufactures to sell facial masks directly to the government, which would then deliver it to residents.[82]
On 5 March, the Japanese government announced that it is organizing an emergency package by using a 270 billion yen ($2.5 billion) reserve fund for the current fiscal year through March to contain the virus and minimize its impact on an economy.
In late February, several Japanese media outlets reported that there were people with fever or other symptoms who could not be tested through the consultation centre system and had become ""test refugees"" (Japanese: 検査難民).[83][84][85][86] Some of these cases involved patients with severe pneumonia.[87] In reaction to this problem, the chairman of the Institute for Healthcare Governance Masahiro Kami claimed that many patients were refused to be tested due to their mild symptoms and criticized the Japanese government for setting testing standards that were too high and for lacking a response to patient anxiety.[88]
On 26 February, the Minister of Health Katsunobu stated in the National Diet that a total of 6,300 samples were tested between 18 and 24 February, averaging 900 samples per day. Some representatives questioned the discrepancy of the actual number of people tested and the claim in the prior week that 3,800 samples could be tested per day.[89]
South Korean media outlets have also compared the number of samples tested and the number of confirmed cases between Japan and South Korea, leading them to believe that there are more cases of the virus in Japan. This has led to speculations in South Korea that the decision not to increase the number of samples tested was influenced by the country's plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics.[90][91]
On the same day, more doctors reported that they were refused by the public health centres to test the patients. The Japan Medical Association announced that it would start a nationwide investigation and plan to cooperate with the government to improve the situation.[92] The Ministry of Health also stated that it would look into the situation with the local governments.[93]
According to an NHK News poll conducted from 6 to 9 March 2020, 6% of respondents strongly approved of the national government's response, while 43% somewhat approved, 34% somewhat disapproved and 13% strongly disapproved of the government response. Specifically, 69% viewed the closure of most schools as unavoidable, while 24% viewed the action as too drastic. Regarding the entry restrictions from China and South Korea, 36% strongly approved, 41% somewhat approved, 13% somewhat disapproved and 5% strongly disapproved.[94] On the other hand, the South Korean government criticized the Japanese government for restricting Koreans from entering the country to prevent the disease, saying, ""unreasonable and excessive measures"".[95][96]
Apart from individual quarantine measures, Japan does not have any laws that allow the government to restrict the movement of people in order to contain the virus.  Compliance with government requests to restrict movements is based on ""asking for public cooperation to ‘protect people’s lives’ and minimize further damage to [the economy]"".[97]
Prime Minister Shinzō Abe has said that ""the new coronavirus is having a major impact on tourism, the economy and our society as a whole"".[98][99] Face masks have sold out across the nation and stocks of face masks are depleted within a day of new arrivals.[100] There has been pressure placed on the healthcare system as demands for medical checkups increase.[101] Chinese people have reported increasing discrimination.[102] The health minister has pointed out that the situation has not reached a point where mass gatherings must be called off.[103]
Aviation, retail and tourism sectors have reported decreased sales and some manufacturers have complained about disruption to Chinese factories, logistics and supply chains.[104] Prime Minister Abe has considered using emergency funds to mitigate the outbreak's impact on tourism, of which Chinese nationals account for 40%.[105] S&P Global noted that the worst hit shares were from companies spanning travel, cosmetics and retail sectors which are most exposed to Chinese tourism.[106] Nintendo announced that they would delay shipment of the Nintendo Switch, which is manufactured in China, to Japan.[107]
On 28 February 2020, according to Oriental Land, a leisure and amusement company confirmed report, Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea and Tokyo Disney Resort were temporarily closed from 29 February, with operations to resume in early April.[page needed] The Comcast-owned Universal Studios Japan also announced a closure on the same day. The latter would also resume on 16 March.[108] The governor of Hokkaido, Naomichi Suzuki, declared a state of emergency due to the high number of new infections and asked citizens to stay at home that following weekend.[109]
The outbreak itself has been a concern for the 2020 Summer Olympics which is scheduled to take place in Tokyo starting at the end of July. The national government has thus been taking extra precautions to help minimise the outbreak's impact.[110][111] The Tokyo organising committee and the International Olympic Committee have been monitoring the outbreak's impact in Japan.[110]
Additionally, the outbreak has affected professional sports in Japan. Nippon Professional Baseball's preseason games and the Haru Basho sumo tournament in Osaka were announced to be held behind closed doors, while the J.League (soccer) and Top League (rugby) suspended or postponed play entirely.[112] Horseracing, Keirin, Kyotei and Auto race events remain on their usual schedule, but spectators cannot enter racecourse and cannot bet at offtrack betting. Customers can only bet over the internet and by telephone.[113]
On 26 February, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has suggested that major sporting, cultural and other events should be cancelled, delayed or scaled down for about two weeks amid the new coronavirus outbreak.[114]
On 27 February, AnimeJapan 2020, originally scheduled to be held in Tokyo Big Sight in late March, was announced to be cancelled.[115]
On 28 February, Legoland Japan Resort was closed for three weeks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The park reopened on March 23, 2020 with short business hours, staff wearing masks, and temperature checks. Reopening was decided by confined space, density, and social distance.[116][117]
Affected by the shortage of outsourced staff due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many Japanese animated films and TV shows announced changes or postponed broadcasts due to production problems, including A Certain Scientific Railgun T (deferred for broadcast, changed to rebroadcast), Asteroid in Love, A3! (Delay extension), Kukuriraige -Sanxingdui Fantasy- (Delay extension), etc.[118][119]
On 26 January, Japanese people donated a batch of epidemic prevention masks and delivered them to Wuhan after Sichuan Airlines arrived in Chengdu.[120] According to ""liberal digital times"" of Taiwan, it believes that instead of donating from Japan, China bought from Japan,[121] but according to Japanese media reports and the Japanese Consulate General in Chongqing [ja] stated that it was a donation.[122][123]
On 3 February, four organizations, the Japan Pharmaceutical NPO Corporation, the Japan Hubei Federation, Huobi Global, and Incuba Alpha, donated materials to Hubei and wrote, ""Is it clothesless? With the same clothes."" (From ""Book of Songs · Qin Feng · No Clothes"") and ""An Exotic Mountain and River, Same Wind and Moon"".[124]
On 10 February, Liberal Democratic Party's Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai said at a press conference after the cadre meeting that the outbreak of coronavirus in mainland China has expanded, The Liberal Democratic Party will deduct 5,000 yen from the March funding of members of the party to provide mainland China with support funds.[125]
On 1 February, a 37-year-old man of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department working for the Cabinet Secretariat, which was responsible for the evacuation of citizens from Wuhan and other related matters, died at National Institute of Public Health in Saitama Prefecture. The institute was where some of the evacuees from Wuhan stayed under temporary quarantine. Police are investigating the man's cause of death, but they suspect he was suicidal.[126]
The following countries and territories have restricted entry from Japan:

Vietnam ,"
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Vietnam on 23 January 2020.[1] As of 24 March 2020, there were 134 confirmed cases, with 17 recoveries and 0 deaths.[2]
On 23 January, Vietnam confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19, a Chinese man (#1) travelling from Wuhan to Hanoi to visit his son who lived in Vietnam, and his son (#2), who was believed to have contracted the disease from his father. They were hospitalised on 22 January at Chợ Rẫy Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City.[4] On 24 January, Acting Minister of Health Vũ Đức Đam ordered the activation of the Emergency Epidemic Prevention Centre.[5] On 29 January, the son fully recovered and was discharged.[6] His father was discharged on 12 February.[7]
A week later, three positive cases were confirmed by the Ministry of Health, involving Vietnamese nationals who had returned from Wuhan. Case No. 3 (25-yr-old female) was quarantined and cured in Thanh Hóa Province, while the other two cases (#4: 29-yr-old male; #5: 23-yr-old female) are hospitalised in Hanoi.[8][9] Case No. 5 was discharged on 3 February, fully recovered and tested negative with the virus.[10]
On 1 February, a 25-year-old woman (#6) was declared coronavirus-positive in Khánh Hòa Province. She has worked as a receptionist and had direct contact with the Chinese father and son (cases #1–2).[11] This case was discharged from the hospital on 4 February.[12] Noticeably, this case was the first domestic transmission in Vietnam, leading to an epidemic declaration signed by the Vietnamese Prime Minister and calls for border tightening, aviation permits revoked, and visa restriction.[13][14][15][16]
On 2 February, a Vietnamese American (#7) got infected with coronavirus, due to two-hour layover in Wuhan airport during his trip from the US.[17]
On 3–4 February, Vietnam announced their eighth and ninth case: a 29-year-old female (#8) and a 30-year-old male (#9). They belonged to the same training team with the previous confirmed cases of three (cases #3-through-5).[18][19]
Later on 4 February, the 10th case was identified. A 42-year-old female met and greeted with the case No. 5 during Lunar New Year holiday.[20] Mother (49-year-old, #11) and younger sister (16-year-old, #12) of the case No. 5 were also transmitted on 6 February.[21]
On 7 February, Vietnam confirmed their 13th case, a 29-year-old worker, who is a member of the same training crew with 5 previously confirmed cases (case #3,4,5,8,9).[22] Earlier of the same day, Vietnam declared to have successfully cultured and isolated the virus in the lab. This is one of the few countries able to do this, aside from Singapore, Australia, Japan and China.[23]
On 9 February, a 55-year-old woman, a neighbour of case No. 5, tested positive; the 14th case.[24]
On 10 February, three more cases: #4, #5 and #9 were declared to be recovered.[25]
The 15th case was identified on 11 February, a 3-month-old grandchild of case No. 10.[26]
On 13 February, father of case No. 5 was tested positive, making the number of cases in Vietnam 16.[27]
On 25 February, the 16th was released from the hospital after being tested negative from the COVID-19, temporarily made Vietnam cleared from COVID-19 outbreak.[28] However, quarantine measures continue to be imposed until further notice.[29]
On 6 March night, Hanoi urgently announced a new case of coronavirus, the first one found in the capital of Vietnam, just a few days before the country was to declare itself COVID-19-free. The patient, a 26-year-old woman, had been travelling across Europe during the outbreak. She had been exhibiting several symptoms, but didn't notify the authorities about her travel history or health conditions.[30] The government has isolated roughly 200 people who had close contact, live on the same street, or were on the same flight as the patient.[31][32] The incident also sparked a wave of stockpiling purchases across the city.[33]
On 7 March afternoon, a 27-year-old Vietnamese was put into quarantine in Ninh Binh Province, after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, making this the 18th case. The patient had been in Daegu for several days.[34] Just 2 hours later, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health confirmed 2 more cases, both related to the 17th case.[35]
On 8 March, another case in Hanoi was announced, which was a 61-year-old man.[36] Later this day, 9 more cases was announced, with 4 cases in Quảng Ninh, 2 cases in Lào Cai, 2 cases in Đà Nẵng and 1 case in Thừa Thiên - Huế. All of them were on the same flight with case #17.[37]
On 9 March evening, a 49-year-old British man was put into quarantine in Quảng Nam Province, related to patient number 17.[38]
On 10 March, a 24-year-old Vietnamese woman was announced positive with the virus and had close contact with case #17 while in London. After she acknowledged that case #17 was infected, she flew back to Vietnam in a private jet with quarantined cabin to seek healthcare in her home country.[39] Later that day, another British man was found infected with the virus, who was on the same flight with case #17.[40] Before the end of the day, the 34th case was identified, a 51-year-old businesswoman who had visited the United States, with a brief transit in Korea and Qatar during the trip.[41]
On 11 March, Vietnam confirmed their 35th case of COVID-19, a 29-year-old woman who works in an electronics supermarket in Da Nang, and had physical contact with two infected British tourists.[42] Within the same day, 3 more case were discovered, all are related to patient number 34.[43]
On 12 March morning, Vietnamese Ministry of Health reported the 39th case of the country. This case is a 29-year-old tour guide in Hanoi, who had contact with patient number 24 during a trip to Ninh Binh.[44] Evening of the same day, five more cases were announced, all are related to patient number 34.[45]
On 13 March, 3 more cases were announced.[46][47]
On 14 March, 6 cases were announced. Aside from cases related to flight VN0054 and patient 34, there are 3 unrelated cases: A Vietnamese came back from Paris, a Vietnamese overseas student who has been travelling across Europe, and a Czech national.[48]
On 16 March, a new case was reported in Vietnam, known as the 61st patient. The patient, a Muslim from the Cham minority, had participated in the Tablighi Jamaat in Sri Petaling mosque, Malaysia, where he got infected before returning to Vietnam and attended the Jamiul Muslimin Mosque in Ho Chi Minh City before returning home in Ninh Thuận. Due to the wide range of people he contacted, it raised the fear of the patient being a super spread patient. Eventually, the Vietnamese authorities decided to isolate and quarantine the whole province, as well as shut the mosque.[49][50][51] Subsequently, a new-found case connected with the man were also discovered the following days.[52] On 22 March, another case also related to the Islamic activities is a fellow Muslim who returned from Malaysia also attended in the same Sri Petaling mosque, before went back to Vietnam and still did Islamic praying five times a day in Jamiul Anwar mosque, despite being asked to quarantine at home.[53]
On 22 March, Vietnam recorded over fourteen new patients, surpassing over 100 patients for the first time. Many returned from various countries, including Britain, Malaysia and France; which are severely hit by the coronavirus.[54][54]
The rising number of patients had caused serious concerns. Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyễn Xuân Phúc ordered measures to prevent and counter the spread of the disease into Vietnam,[68] as well as to warn Vietnamese citizens to avoid visiting areas with outbreaks.[69] Deputy minister Đỗ Xuân Tuyên said that Vietnam is considering closing the border with China as a necessary countermeasure.[70] Saigon Tourist announced that it cancelled all tours to or with transit in Wuhan.[71] On 24 January, the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam ordered the cancellation of all flights from and to Wuhan.[72][73]
In February 2020, Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training suspended all school activities across the country until the end of March as part of quarantine measures against the spreading of the virus, and later extended this till the middle of April until further notice.[74] Aggressive measures were also taken to combat possible outbreaks, from 14 days quarantine to restriction of outdoor activities (some sources believe it was more than 20 to 40 days under quarantine),[75] the Vietnam People's Armed Forces also takes part on patrolling and controlling measures.[76]
Rumours also spread that Chinese nationals fled to Vietnam from Guangxi from a video, which triggered public reactions that Chinese nationals might be escaping from the coronavirus outbreak. It was later denied by the Vietnamese and Chinese governments as misleading. The Agence France-Presse also condemned the footage as fake.[77]
South Korean nationals are also reportedly screened due to the rampant outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea, which has extensive trade relationship with Vietnam.[78][79]
Stores across Vietnam were quickly sold out of surgical masks and hand sanitisers after the initial cases of coronavirus were reported. This followed a similar trend in many other Asian countries due to the outbreak.[80] Interim Health Minister Vũ Đức Đam urged the public to remain calm during the outbreak, and to avoid excessive emergency shopping.[81] Vietnamese authorities also arrested people using the outbreak to profiteer.[82]
Like most of the world's economy, Vietnam was hit hard by the outbreak, due to the slowdown of private and national industries, the downturn of stock exchanges and the lower number of incoming tourists, though Vietnam is expected to be harmed less than China.[83]
The outbreak also forced 2020 V.League 1 to be delayed to 7 March until further announcement, which affected the preparation of Vietnam national football team for the upcoming 2022 World Cup qualification.[84][85]
Vietnam has prepared for the epidemic as early as the very first case in China emerged, around mid-December 2019. Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam stated that the Government Office, Army forces and Minister of Health have worked out various plans in case the number of affected cases burst out.[86] The Deputy Prime Minister added that the country ""has won the first round"" in the fight against the virus with 16 confirmed cases, 16 recoveries, and 0 death.[87]
Vietnamese response has gathered praises from several figures, comparing it to the fast Vietnamese response back in 2003 when the SARS outbreak occurred when Vietnam became the first country to be cleared of SARS. United States Ambassador to Vietnam, Daniel Kritenbrink, had praised Vietnam for its fast measures against the outbreak.[88] US delegation also praised Vietnam for its quarantine efforts, and have cooperated with the Vietnamese Embassy in the United States.[89]
However, Vietnam also received criticism for its response. Secretary-General of Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyễn Thành Phong, admitted the lack of facilities and expressed wary that the government did not act enough, and if the city has to take over 1.000 patients, it will break.[90] Overseas Vietnamese accused the government of its passive reactions and censorship.[91]
Several Vietnamese, including those of diaspora, and foreign tourists, accused the quarantine centres to be lousy, ugly and insufficient; there were even clashes between officials and those who're quarantined.[92][93][94][95]
Islamophobia was also reported due to the increasing number of the infects coming from the Vietnamese Muslim community returning from Malaysia following their attendance to the Tablighi Jamaat festival in Sri Petaling mosque, and two to three patients did not obey the self-quarantine law in Vietnam but still attend Islamic events in Ho Chi Minh City, leading to fury and demand to imprison the Muslim population, even among Vietnamese celebrities.[96]
Vietnam's National Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health commissioned artists to release the song  ""Ghen Cô Vy"" (Jealous Coronavirus) which recommended correct handwashing technique[97] and was a remake of 2017 song ""Ghen"" (Jealous), has gone viral amidst the coronavirus outbreak, first earned praises from John Oliver in his talk show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and became increasingly popular among public and frequently duplicated by netizens, with UNICEF recommended the video to fight back the fear of coronavirus.[98][99] An English version is under development process.

Afghanistan ,"
This article documents the impacts of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Afghanistan, and may not include all the contemporary major responses and measures.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic was confirmed to have spread to Afghanistan when its first case, in Herat, was confirmed on 24 February 2020.[1]
On 23 February, at least three citizens of Herat who had recently returned from Qom, Iran were suspected of COVID-19 infection. Blood samples were sent to Kabul for further testing.[2]
On 24 February, Afghanistan confirmed the first COVID-19 case involving one of the three people from Herat, a 35-year-old man, who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.[3]
On 7 March, three new cases were confirmed in Herat Province.[4] The new total of positive cases in Afghanistan had risen to 4.
On 10 March, the first case was reported outside of Herat province, in Samangan Province, meaning that there was a total of five cases in Afghanistan. The patient had also returned from travels in Iran.[5] This later rose to seven in the evening, as the Ministry of Public Health announced one new case in both Herat and Samangan provinces.[6]
Also during that week, 30,000 Afghan immigrants were reported to have returned from Iran, via Islam Qala port, after the outbreak in the country. This marked the highest rate of returning immigrants from Iran in over a decade.[7][8]
On 14 March, the tenth positive case was confirmed. The Ministry of Public Health announced that Balkh Province and Kapisa Province had their first cases.

Hong Kong has seen high-profile protests that saw tourist arrivals from Mainland China plummet over an eight-month period. The viral epidemic put additional pressure on the travel sector to withstand a prolonged period of downturn.[32] A drop in arrivals from third countries more resilient during the previous months has also been cited as a concern.[33] The city is already in recession[32] and Moody has lowered the city's credit rating.[34][35] The worst economic effects from the outbreak are expected for Australia, Hong Kong and China.[36]
There has also been a renewed increase in protest activity as hostile sentiment against Mainland Chinese strengthened over fears of viral transmission from Mainland China, with many calling for the border ports to be closed and for all Mainland Chinese travellers to be refused entry. Incidents have included a number of petrol bombs being thrown at police stations,[37] a homemade bomb exploding in a toilet,[38] and foreign objects being thrown onto transit rail tracks between Hong Kong and the Mainland Chinese border.[39] Political issues raised have included concerns that Mainland Chinese may prefer to travel to Hong Kong to seek free medical help (which has since been addressed by the Hong Kong government).[40][41]
Since the outbreak of the virus, a significant number of products have been sold out across the city, including face masks and disinfectant products (such as alcohol and bleach).[42] An ongoing period of panic buying has also caused many stores to be cleared of non-medical products such as bottled water, vegetables and rice.[43] The Government of Hong Kong had its imports of face masks cancelled as global face mask stockpiles decline.[44]
In view of the coronavirus outbreak, the Education Bureau closed all kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools and special schools until 20 April.[45] The disruption has raised concerns over the situation of students who are due to take examinations at the end of the year, especially in light of the protest-related disruption that happened in 2019.[46]
On 5 February, flag carrier Cathay Pacific requested its 27,000 employees to voluntarily take three weeks of unpaid leave by the end of June. The airline had previously reduced flights to mainland China by 90% and to overall flights by 30%.[47]

Iceland ,"
This article documents the impacts of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic in Iceland and may not include all the contemporary major responses and measures. As of 24 March, the total number of cases registered is 648, of which 56 have recovered.[1]
On 28 February, Iceland confirmed the first case of COVID-19, an Icelandic male in his forties, who had been on a ski trip to Andalo in Northern Italy and returned home on 22 February; when he developed symptoms after his arrival, he was quarantined at Landspítali hospital in Reykjavík.[4][5] Subsequently, The National Commission of the Icelandic Police declared an Alert Phase.[6]
On 1 March, a second and a third case were confirmed, an Icelandic male in his fifties who had returned home on 29 February from Verona, and a female in her fifties who had returned home from Italy via Munich.[7]
On 2 March, additional six cases were confirmed, bringing the total to nine: five men and four women. All cases to date have been in the Reykjavík area. Five of those cases have been traced to Italy.[8] In response, the Directorate of Health has defined Italy as a risk area for the disease, and all those arriving to Iceland from Italy are being asked to go into a 14-day home quarantine.[9] The ninth case is that of an Icelander who had spent time in Austria and flew home on 1 March.[10] After additional cases were traced to Ischgl in Austria, the Health Directorate defined Ischgl as a high-risk area.[11] Authorities in the Tyrol state of Austria however contend that the Icelanders returning from Ischgl probably became infected on their flight from Munich but this is considered ""very unlikely"" by Icelandic health authorities as this group presented symptoms very soon after the flight.[12][13]
On 3 March, in an official press report, sanctions were announced for those who break the quarantine, which includes up to three months in prison, as it is considered an intentional contagion of the virus.[14]
As of 5 March, around 400 people are in home-based quarantine in Iceland and around 330 individuals have been tested for the virus, but no cases of transmission within the community had been identified. Among individuals who had been tested for the virus, 35 had been confirmed as infected with COVID-19, but officials warned that this figure would rise when additional test results become available in the next days.[15]
On 6 March, the total number of infected rose to 45, including the first 4 cases of local transmission of the virus.[13][16] Iceland's Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management declared a civil protection distress phase within minutes of local transmission of COVID-19 being officially confirmed.[17]
On 7 March, 5 additional cases were confirmed: 3 cases of local transmission and 2 from previously defined high risk areas. All seven confirmed cases of local transmission are in the Reykjavík area. A total of 484 tests have been administered to date.[18]
On 8 March, the total rose to 58, a total of 10 of which are cases of local transmission.[19] Three cases identified on 8 March were of Icelandic residents who had returned to Iceland on a special flight from Verona on 7 March; all passengers were Icelandic residents who had spent time in high-risk areas, and special precautions had already been taken to ensure that they would remain isolated from other passengers on arrival to Keflavík International Airport.[20]
On 9 March, two additional passengers from the special flight from Verona on 7 March tested positive for COVID-19.[21] Three cases of local transmission were identified and two cases of Icelandic residents returning from ski areas in the Alps, bringing the total to 65.[22]
As of 8 March, no COVID-19 patients were ill enough to require hospitalisation.[23]
On 11 March, it was reported that a COVID-19 patient had developed more severe symptoms and admitted to hospital, thus becoming the first patient in Iceland to develop more than mild symptoms of the disease. Also on 11 March, 90 people in total had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and 700 were under quarantine.[24]
On 13 March, it was announced at a press conference that universities and secondary schools would be closing as of Monday 16 March, on which day a ban on public gatherings of over 100 would be put in place.[25]
On 15 March, it was reported that three COVID-19 patients in Iceland were now in hospital, one in intensive care, and a health clinic in the capital city area (in Mosfellsbær) has been closed after an employee tested positive for COVID-19. A total of 171 cases have been confirmed, a majority of which can be traced to ski areas in the Alps. Chief Epidemiologist Þórólfur Guðnason stated that half of all persons in Iceland who have tested positive for COVID-19 were already self-quarantining (after either returning home from international travel or having been in contact with an infected person), suggesting that measures to control the outbreak through quarantine and isolation in Iceland have been effective so far.[26] An estimated 2500 persons are self-isolating, with the number rising daily.[27]
On 17 March, the first person with coronavirus was confirmed dead, an Australian citizen around 40 who was visiting Iceland with his wife.[28] He sought medical attention because of serious illness and died shortly after arriving at the Húsavík health clinic.[29] His symptoms were atypical and his condition worsened extremely quickly. With the permission of his family, it was reported on 19 March that he had developed pneumonia and that COVID-19 was the probable cause of death.[30]
On 23 March, an Icelandic woman in her early 70s passed away from COVID-19 after a week-long battle with the illness.[31]

On 24 January, the Directorate of Health announced preventive measures to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Passengers arriving at the Keflavík International Airport with signs of respiratory infection and asymptomatic individuals who had been either in Wuhan for the past 14 days were medically assessed at the airport.[32]
From 2 March, healthcare workers in Iceland were being encouraged to avoid travel and to remain in the country.[33]
As of 16 March, no official social distancing measures or limitations or bans on public gatherings are in effect.[34] However, organisers cancelled or postponed a number of upcoming events, including the annual conference of the School of Humanities of the University of Iceland, Hugvísindaþing, which was set to have taken place on 13 and 14 March.[35]
At a press conference on 13 March, it was announced that public gatherings of more than 100 would be banned and universities and secondaries schools closed for four weeks. Later that day, announcements were made that stated or emphasised that: 
The Directorate of Health and The Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management have jointly launched an official website,[when?] with the latest information in Icelandic and English.[38]
On 16 March, the supermarket chain Samkaup announced that 27 grocery shops throughout Iceland would have special shopping times for vulnerable members of the public, including the elderly and those with chronic and underlying illnesses. Beginning 17 March, select Nettó and Kjörbúðin locations would reserve the hour from 9 to 10 a.m. for those shoppers at greatest risk of severe complications should they contract COVID-19.[39]
As of 18 March, the whole world is defined as a high risk area. All travel abroad is discouraged and residents in Iceland who are currently abroad are encouraged to return home as soon as possible. Residents in Iceland who arrive from abroad will now go into quarantine.[40]
On 21 March, a stricter ban on public assemblies was put in place in Vestmannaeyjar. Assemblies there with more than 10 persons would now be prohibited.[41] A still stricter ban was announced for the Húnaþing vestra district, where all inhabitants have been ordered to stay at home except to buy necessities.[42]
From 00:00 on 24 March, a nation-wide ban on public assemblies over 20 took effect. All swimming pools, museums, libraries and bars closed, as did any businesses requiring a proximity of more than 2 m (hairdressers, tattoo artists, etc.).[43]
Icelandic health officials have used voluntary home-based quarantines for all residents returning from defined high-risk areas and virus testing as the primary means of preventing transmission within the community. Icelandic health officials have tested a proportionately high number of arriving passengers from high-risk areas for COVID-19, with the hope that early detection of infections will prevent their spread. The high number of infections identified thus does not reflect the prevalence of COVID-19 in Iceland.[44]
An early concern among Icelandic residents placed in home-based quarantine has been employees' rights to paid leave while being quarantined; it was announced on 5 March that the COVID-19 outbreak will likely result in changes to legislation within the next weeks.[45]
Those with symptoms of COVID-19 are asked to avoid health care centres and hospitals without calling ahead, to avoid exposing vulnerable individuals to the virus. Even mild symptoms of illness that should be reported to 1700 (+354 544–4113 for foreign numbers) for further guidance.[46] In case of emergency, call 112.
Official quarantine facilities for healthy individuals unable to enter a home-based quarantine (for example, foreign nationals) have been established at a local hotel in Reykjavík. The Icelandic Red Cross will assist those who require help with acquiring necessities during quarantine and isolation. Any person in quarantine or isolation in Iceland can contact the Red Cross Helpline at 1717 (+354 580 1710 from foreign numbers), which is open 24/7.
Initially, COVID-19 testing for Icelandic residents in quarantine took place mainly in their own homes. Due to the high volume of tests required, the decision was made to use mobile units parked outside health clinics; individuals not experiencing severe symptoms who require testing must currently contact 1700/+354 544–4113 to book a time and location.[23]
A shortage of tests has reduced the volume of COVID-19 testing in Iceland, hampering control and tracing efforts. It was announced on 22 March that an order of 5000 swabs set to arrive the following week had been reduced at short notice by 3000.[47]

North Korea ,"
There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in North Korea, although South Korean sources say that the disease is already affecting the country. The alleged entrance of the virus into North Korea is not thought to come from South Korea, which itself has had a high amount of reported COVID-19 cases, but rather from China, where the virus originates. Border restrictions are more relaxed between China and North Korea than between North and South Korea, which have a heavily militarized border, while traffic and black market trade is prominent across the Chinese-North Korean border. However, suspected COVID-19 cases in the two provinces (Liaoning and Jilin) bordering North Korea have been low.[1]
As of mid-March, it was unclear whether the government had successfully prevented COVID-19 from spreading, was deliberately concealing confirmed cases, or was simply unable to reliably test for the virus.[2]
North Korea is an impoverished country with weak healthcare infrastructure and is subject to sanctions, making it vulnerable in the event of an outbreak.[3][4] There is concern that widespread malnutrition could worsen the spread of COVID-19.[1] Diplomatically and economically isolated,[1] it borders China, the starting point of the pandemic, which is North Korea's closest ally and a source of tourists. According to NK News, the number of tour buses entering North Korea from China increased in 2019, prompting the Chinese government to enforce limits more strictly.[4]
North Korea's government is secretive and the media is tightly controlled, making it hard for outside observers to determine what is really going on in the country.[1]
Historically, North Korea has cut off travel in the face of epidemics abroad, for instance during the 2014 Ebola epidemic.[4] Moreover, the country has had success in disease eradication in the past; it reportedly eliminated measles in 2018.[5][1] North Korea's government is highly authoritarian and maintains strong control over the country, which experts anticipated could help in enforcing disease control measures such as social distancing.[1][6]
North Korea was one of the first countries to close borders due to COVID-19.[7] The government has implemented widespread travel restrictions,[8] including closing the border to foreign tourists in late January[4] and then suspending flights and banning travel in and out of the country.[7] Though many parts of the border were closed, the bridge between Dandong and Sinuiju remained open and allowed supplies to be delivered.[2]
The possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in North Korea is a concern to international organizations and observers due to the country's poverty and low-quality healthcare infrastructure. Outside organizations have provided aid to help the country fight the virus: the Russian government provided test kits,[2] the World Health Organization announced plans to send supplies despite the lack of confirmed cases, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, U.S. State Department, and South Korean government all indicated willingness to help.[1] The U.S. government worked with the United Nations to make exceptions to sanctions, though they were also criticized for slowing down the process for providing aid.[8] Doctors Without Borders provided medical supplies via Dandong in March 2020.[8]
In early February 2020, the North Korean government was reported to take harsh measures to block the spread of the coronavirus. Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers' Party of Korea, reported that the customs officials at Nampho port were performing disinfection activities, including placing imported goods in quarantine.[9] Schools were closed throughout the country; university students in Pyongyang from elsewhere in the country were confined to their dormitories.[10][11]
People were quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus.[12] Diplomats and other foreigners were evacuated to Vladivostok in March.[8][2]
The North Korean military fired five missiles on two occasions in early March 2020, which may be ""an effort to ensure the country remains on the agenda for other nations amid the virus outbreak"".[1] More missile tests followed in late March, along with an announcement that the Supreme People's Assembly would meet in early April. Foreign observers said the government was trying to show confidence in their handling of the virus.[13]
On 18 March 2020, North Korea leader Kim Jong-un ordered the construction of new hospitals in North Korea, while also continuing to deny any cases of COVID-19.
Kim Jong-un sent a letter to South Korean President Moon Jae-in as a show of support amidst the outbreak in South Korea.[14] On 21 March 2020, North Korea said that United States President Donald Trump wrote a letter to Kim Jong-un to express that he is willing to work with him on dealing with COVID-19.[15]
Although South Korean media shared news hinting at the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic to North Korea, the WHO denied the veracity of such claims. On 18 February, Rodong Sinmun quoted a public health official reiterating the country had had ""no confirmed case of the new coronavirus so far"". The WHO prioritised aid for North Korea, including the shipment of protective equipment and supplies.[16]
In early March, the North Korean government continued to deny that they had any cases of COVID-19. However, according to South Korean media outlet Daily NK, 180 soldiers had died. There was no estimate of those merely infected.[17]
In February and March, U.S. officials observed a decrease in military activity in North Korea, believed to be a sign that there are COVID-19 cases in the country.[1] General Robert B. Abrams observed that the North Korean military had ""been on lockdown for about 30 days"" and ""didn’t fly an airplane for 24 days"".[1]
The underground network that assists defectors in escaping North Korea has been almost unable to operate amidst strict controls implemented to stop the virus, with defection attempts being suspended.[18] Defection rates had been declining already, probably due to increased security under the administrations of Kim Jong-un in North Korea and Xi Jinping in China.[18]
From 23 January, North Korea banned foreign tourists.[19]
On 23 January, suspected cases in Sinuiju were quarantined.[needs update][20]
On 30 January, North Korea's news agency KCNA declared a ""state emergency"" and reported the establishment of anti-epidemic headquarters around the country.[21]
On 2 February, KCNA reported that all the people who had entered the country after 13 January were placed under ""medical supervision.""[21]
On 7 February, South Korean media outlet Daily NK claimed that five North Koreans in Sinuiju of North Pyongan Province died.[22] Within the same day, The Korea Times reported that a North Korean female living in the capital Pyongyang was infected.[23] Despite no confirmation by North Korean authorities on the claims, the country has implemented stricter measures to combat the spread of the virus.[24][25]
Schools were closed starting on 20 February.[11]
On 29 February, Kim Jong-un called for stronger measures to be taken to prevent COVID-19 from spreading to North Korea.[26]
On 14 March 2020, North Korea state media reported there were no confirmed cases in its territory.[27]
On 18 March 2020, Kim Jong-un ordered the construction of new hospitals in North Korea while also continuing to deny any cases of COVID-19 in North Korea. North Korean state media also reported that groundbreaking on a new hospital was underway the day prior on Tuesday 17 March. Kim Jong-un reportedly told a newspaper linked to the ruling Workers' Party of Korea that the construction of new hospitals were being done for general improvement of the nation's healthcare system without mentioning COVID-19.[28]
On 20 March 2020, North Korean media said that more than 2,590 people had been released from quarantine in North Pyongan and South Pyongan provinces. All but three quarantined foreigners had been released.[12]

Guernsey ,"
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic in the Bailiwick of Guernsey is part of an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a novel infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case in the Bailiwick was confirmed on 9 March 2020 when a person tested positive in Guernsey after returning from Tenerife. Chief Minister Gavin St Pier has on several occasions compared the impact of the pandemic on the Bailiwick to that of the second world war.[3][4]
The response by the States of Guernsey has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)—a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island—and advised by the senior Policy and Resources Committee (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enabled the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick self-isolate for 14 days.
Early measures focused on behaviour changing publicity; encouraging regular hand-washing, practising good respiratory hygiene and observing social distancing measures. Non-essential travel was discouraged, and policies were implemented to give financial support to businesses and individuals. Other responses included the cancellation of events, the closure of schools and restrictions on travel. Following a further increase in cases and, in particular, the confirmation of a case resulting from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March. The strict measures comprise wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to 'stay at home'.
Efforts are being directed towards developing local testing facilities to reduce the time taken for results to be received. Currently, samples are being sent to specialist laboratories in the UK, but due to the increased demand for tests, the time taken for results to be received has significantly increased beyond the standard 48 hours. As of 24 March, 398 samples have been tested, yielding 23 positive results and 286 negative results with 89 results yet to be confirmed.[note 3][2] There have been no deaths relating to the coronavirus.
A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in late December 2019 as the cause of a cluster of cases of an acute respiratory disease now referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).[5] As of March 2020 more than 170 countries and territories have been affected, with major outbreaks in China, Italy, South Korea and Iran.[6][7] On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) characterised the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic.[8][9]
As of 24 March, 398 samples have been tested, yielding 23 positive results and 286 negative results with 89 results yet to be confirmed.[2]
Currently, samples from Guernsey are sent off-island to be tested by a specialist laboratory in the UK.[24] Due to the increased demand on UK laboratories to conduct tests, the time taken for results to be received has significantly increased beyond the standard 48 hours.[2] On 21 March, Public Health Services announced that results from tests taken between 11 and 14 March were delayed by over a week, while results for other tests conducted between 17 and 19 March had already been received.[18]
Due to the impracticalities and delays arising from off-island testing, a testing facility is being developed in Guernsey which according to the Policy and Resources Committee, is expected to be carrying out tests by April and to deliver results within 24 hours.[25][26] On 24 March, the Director of Public Health confirmed that the island would have two ways of testing for the coronavirus, with results availabe in half a day, and that tests would be prioritised for healthcare workers, hospital patients with respiratory symptoms and islanders showing the relevant symptoms needing to see a doctor.[27]
Dr Nicola Brink, the government's Director for Public Health, explained the process of dealing with suspected cases as follows:[28]
Those who have been contacted directly by the States of Guernsey and ordered to self-isolate (such as individuals with confirmed cases, contacts of confirmed cases and individuals booked for testing or awaiting test results) are subject to regular welfare checks by Public Health Services.[29]
The States of Guernsey's response to the pandemic is coordinated by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA), a body made up of several committee Presidents including the head of the Policy and Resources Committee (P&R) and the island's senior politician, Gavin St Pier. The body is responsible ""for coordinating actions in a range of circumstances, including those that present a serious risk to the health and welfare of Island residents"". The CCA is advised by the States of Guernsey's senior committee, the Policy and Resources Committee (P&R), and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). A separate Coronavirus Political Executive Group was also established to include political representation from all principal States of Guernsey committees to make decisions on matters which do not engage the CCA.[31] In accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for managing a pandemic, the States of Guernsey response and guidance has been designed specifically for the Bailiwick and continues to adapt in line with changing numbers of cases and developing situations in other jurisdictions.[32]
Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enabled the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival from midnight on 19 March.[33][34] The regulations also grant Bailiwick Law Enforcement officers detain individuals whom they suspect may have the coronavirus and present a risk of spreading it to others until the Medical Officer of Health can advise further.[35] On 18 March the States of Guernsey utilised for the first time the databases of telecom partners Sure, JT and Airtel-Vodafone to send a mass SMS message with information about self-isolation to numbers used in the Bailiwick. The technology is reserved for critical emergencies or public health threats.[36]
Early advice given to the public by the States of Guernsey included behaviour changing publicity encouraging hand-washing for at least twenty seconds, avoiding touching your own face, and practising respiratory hygiene as well as advising social distancing and keeping at least 2 metres (6 feet) from others, especially those showing symptoms. In addition, the States of Guernsey published advice on supporting others in the community, encouraging the public to telephone elderly or vulnerable family members, friends and neighbours, offer to shop for those in self-isolation and to avoid non-essential off-island travel.[37] The Health Improvement Commission also published advice and resources with guidance on exercises to keep families healthy and active during self-isolation, recommending two 20-30 minute sessions per day to maintain physical and mental wellbeing. They also clarified that whilst individuals may go outside to exercise alone while social distancing, they should stay at home where possible.[38]
Following the confirmation of a case resulting from on-island transmission, the States of Guernsey announced in a live broadcast on 24 March that it was implementing a 'lockdown' for an initial period of two weeks from 00:01 on 25 March, whereby restrictions would be placed on people's freedom of movement, enforceable by law.[39][40][41] Gavin St Pier drew comparisons with the restrictions to those imposed during the occupation, commenting ""These measures introduce the most far reaching deprivation of personal liberties since the second world war"".[42] The measures require people to stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, medical requirements, two hours of exercise per day, and travelling to and from work for 'essential' jobs which 'absolutely cannot be done from home'. Other measures include the closure of all non-essential shops, businesses and community spaces, and the banning of public gatherings of more than two people (excluding people from the same household).[43] Wedding ceremonies and religious ceremonies were also banned, while funerals would continue but with only immediate family in attendance.[44]
On 19 March the States of Guernsey announced that it had made available a £5 million 'hardship fund' for any islanders (excluding those already eligible to receive national social security benefits) struggling financially from the impact of the pandemic.[45] The same day, the States of Guernsey also published advice to businesses which announced a number of financial 'easements' including deferrals on social insurance payments and commercial tax on real property, and reliefs on rents from government-owned property.[46] On 20 March the finalised emergency financial measures were approved which include £30 million to support businesses, a £40 million loan guarantee scheme for locally-trading firms and a £25 million temporary overdraft for local airline Aurigny.[47]
The States of Guernsey also announced on 23 March that it would be amending population law to protect non-residents who might find themselves without employment as a result of the pandemic and would otherwise be forced to leave the island.[48] On 24 March the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) approved time extensions for businesses to file their financial returns in light of operational issues suffered as a result of the pandemic.[49]
On 24 March the Policy and Resources Committee announced a payroll co-sharing scheme and a grants scheme to support businesses and the self-employed, with both schemes totalling an estimated £41 million. The payroll co-sharing scheme—lasting for an initial period of 13 weeks—will cover 80% of employee wages, based on the Guernsey minimum wage of £8.50 per hour (equating to £238 for a 35-hour week), with the remaining 20% expected to be covered by businesses themselves; there is no restriction placed on the size of the businesses eligible for this scheme. The grants scheme allows small businesses (of fewer than 10 people) and the self-employed to be awarded a £3000 grant to be utilised in ""whichever way they deem appropriate"". The Committee announced that around 1,700 businesses will qualify for the scheme with roughly 10,500 total employees.[50][51]
Guernsey's Committee for Health and Social Care announced on 19 March plans to respond to the development of the spread of the coronavirus on the island. Measures taken include the suspension of elective surgery from 23 March, training staff to ""increase resilience in the provision of critical care"", and limiting in-patients to one visitor at a time.[52] On 23 March the States of Guernsey made the decision to close the hospital to visitors with exceptions for people in end of life care and occupants of the maternity and children's wards.[53] The States of Guernsey have also set up a government funded health insurance scheme to cover the medical bills of any Bailiwick residents who fall ill while visiting the UK, providing they can prove they cannot afford private health insurance.[54]
On 20 March the States of Guernsey imposed restrictions lasting at least ten days on all bars, clubs and premises licensed to serve alcohol stipulating that all nightclubs be closed, bars which do not serve hot food must close, and alcohol may only be served to seated customers at pubs and restaurants if it is ancillary to prepared or plated food.[55] Deputy Gavin St Pier also urged both customers and licensees to respect the spirit, not the letter of the law, and not to look for ways around the restriction,[56] advising those tempted to ""Think again. Watch Netflix and get a takeaway"".[57] Restaurants and premises serving food as well as local gyms remained open for business but were subject to strict regulations ensuring customers are able to physically distance themselves from one another.[58]
On 19 March Guernsey's Director of Public Health announced that all schools in the Bailiwick will be closed from 23 March until at least the end of the Easter break, with the intention to re-open schools once on-island testing is introduced.[24] On 22 March the States of Guernsey announced that children whose parents are both categorised as critical workers (or if one parent is a nurse, doctor, other key health or care worker, teaching staff, or staff essential to supporting the States of Guernsey's response) will be allowed to return to school until scheduled Easter holidays begin, but must continue to observe social distancing measures. Gavin St Pier, head of the Civil Contingencies Authority, said that they predict these measures will see between 10% and 15% of children continuing to attend schools during the temporary stoppage of education.[59]
The States of Guernsey also published advice to students studying in the UK or abroad to return to the island, in light of many institutions closing due to the pandemic, asking in a statement on 17 March that students consider coming home ""sooner rather than later, even if this requires a period of self-isolation"".[35]
On 23 March the Royal Court issued several changes to its procedures in response to the pandemic to allow for social distancing measures. A 'basic provision' of marriage services will still be provided, but staffing will be halved along with closures of the petty debts court, access to the strongroom and limits on people attending the contracts court.[60][61]
Many members of the public have resorted to panic buying at supermarkets and food stores across the Bailiwick, resulting in long queues and shortages of toilet paper, pasta and fresh produce. The Bailiwick Express reported signs informing customers that they were limited to purchasing three of any essential products, security guards place in aisles and tape enforcing social distancing at tills. Addressing the public's panicked response, on 22 March the States of Guernsey gave assurances that the island has ""no current issues with the supply of essential goods"" and implored people to remain considerate of others and stop panic buying, telling those who continue to do so ""to just get a grip and not be so selfish"".[62]
On 11 March it was announced that Guernsey Harbours had cancelled the arrival of a cruise ship scheduled to arrive on 20 March as a precautionary measure.[63] Subsequently, on 19 March individual operators cancelled all cruise trips until the start of may, including nine scheduled to visit the island in April and three in May.[64] On 21 March it was announced that, following directives from the States of Guernsey, no boats are permitted to land on Herm from outside the Bailiwick until at least the end of April.[65] On 23 March Sark Shipping suspended all passenger boats to the island.[66]
On 18 March, local airline Blue Islands offered citizens repatriation flights before the islands passed the isolation deadline;[67] two days later, on 20 March, the airline announced it was stopping all flights out of Guernsey due to lack of demand.[68] On 19 March, local airline Aurigny announced changes to its scheduling which included a reduction in services between some destinations and a suspension of other routes entirely, initially planned to run until 19 April. The airline said the aim of the reduced schedule was to ""reduce costs in this unprecedented period of low demand"" and said they hoped to return to their regular schedule for summer.[69]
On 19 March it was announced that BBC Radio Guernsey would be hosting, as one of the BBC's Local Radio stations, wireless congregations every Sunday between 08:00 and 08:30 in response to churches across the island being closed to indoor public gatherings.[70]
Following government advice on social distancing and limiting contact with others, a number of local cultural and sporting events have been cancelled or postponed including the Guernsey Marathon, the Muratti Vase semi-final, a number of Guernsey F.C. matches, Liberation Day celebrations and the Guernsey Literary festival.[71][72][73]
On 23 March the Beau Sejour Leisure Centre and Guille-Allès public library were closed to the public and the St James concert hall postponed or cancelled events up to September.[74] The same day, Liberation Group——which owns a number of pubs, bars and restaurants in Guernsey—made the decision to close all of its sites.[75]
Airtel-Vodafone announced on 20 March that it had increased customers' data allowance to 50GB for an initial one-month period to support those working from home during the pandemic.[76] Sure also announced it would be offering free upgrades to customers' broadband speeds lasting until July.[77]

On 21 March at midday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced the introduction of a country-wide alert level system, similar to the existing fire warning systems. There are four levels, with 1 being the least risk of infection and 4 the highest. At the time of Ardern's announcement she stated that New Zealand was at level 2. Each level brings added restrictions on activities or movements. Each region can have an individual alert level based on the severity of their own infections, and these levels can be changed at any time.[53][54]
Levels are cumulative – each level includes the restrictions of the level below it. Ardern stated that New Zealanders should always be prepared for the next level. The alert level for all of New Zealand was upgraded to level 3 on 23 March and moved to level 4 on 26 March.[55]
The alert levels are as follows:
On 23 March 2020, the New Zealand Government has released a list of essential services allowed to remain open during the four week lockdown that comes into effect after the country enters a Level 4 alert on midnight 26 March 2020. In addition, the Government is providing a wage subsidy, leave and self-isolation support, and business cash flow and tax measures. These are outlined below.[56][57][58]
There is concern COVID-19 tests have been given only to people who have returned with symptoms from impacted countries or people who have been in contact with a confirmed case.[59] People with symptoms not fitting these categories have not been tested.[60]
NZ case definition for COVID-19 testing from 14 March:[61]
For cases not fitting this case definition doctors are encouraged to use their own judgement whether to test the patient or not.[62]
In early February 2020, the New Zealand Government used a chartered Air New Zealand flight to evacuate 193 passengers from Wuhan, China, including 54 New Zealand citizens, 44 permanent residents, 35 Australians, and several Pacific Islands nationals. 35 Australian passengers were transferred to an Australian flight, while the remaining 157 passengers were quarantined in a military facility at Whangaparaoa for 14 days.

On 19 March, Foreign Minister Winston Peters announced that the New Zealand Government was considering more mercy flights to evacuate New Zealanders stranded overseas in response to the spread of the pandemic to Europe, North America and other international locations.[63][64] On 24 March, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged New Zealanders abroad to return home with while recognising that many will not be able to return home due to the disruption of international travel. Foreign Minister Peters has urged New Zealanders stranded overseas to considering sheltering ""in place."" Peters estimated there were 80,000 New Zealanders stranded overseas; of whom 17,000 have registered with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade's ""Safe Travel"" programme.[65]
On 14 March, ahead of the first anniversary of the Christchurch mosque shootings that killed 51 people, a national remembrance service was cancelled out of concerns over the virus. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the decision was a pragmatic one, adding, ""We're very saddened to cancel [it], but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn't create the risk of further harm being done."" In addition to the remembrance service, an Auckland festival celebrating Pacific culture was also cancelled.[66]
On 14 March, Ardern announced that, effective 01:00 on 16 March, all travellers arriving in or returning to New Zealand from outside of the country must self-isolate for 14 days. This  applies to all travellers, even if they are New Zealand citizens, but excludes travel from the Pacific islands unless the traveller is symptomatic. In addition, restrictions were placed on travel to the Pacific islands from New Zealand, barring travel to the region by those showing signs of coronavirus symptoms, as well as close contacts of coronavirus patients. Cruise ships will be prohibited from docking in New Zealand until 30 June.

South Korea ,"
The first confirmed case of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in South Korea was announced on 20 January 2020.[1] On 19 February, the number of confirmed cases increased by 20 and on 20 February by 58[2] or 70,[3] giving a total of 346 confirmed cases on 21 February 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Korea (KCDC), with the sudden jump mostly attributed to ""Patient 31"" who participated in a gathering at a Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony church in Daegu.[3][4]
Amidst the fears of further contamination, mass gatherings in the affected cities were cancelled and a few hundred soldiers in Daegu are in isolation.[5][6] As of 4 Feb, South Korea denies entry to foreigners traveling from Hubei Province to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[7][8]
As of 24 March 2020, South Korea has about 9,037 cases and 120 deaths,[9] with over 348,582 people having been tested, a case fatality rate of 1.33%, which is lower than the WHO's global case fatality rate of 4.34%.[10]
South Korea introduced what was considered one of the largest and best-organised programs in the world, along with Taiwan,[11] Vietnam,[12] and Singapore.[13] Extensive measures have been taken to screen the population for the virus, and isolate any infected people as well as tracing and quarantining those who contacted them.[14][15] The rapid and extensive measures taken by South Korea has been judged successful in limiting the spread of the outbreak despite not using the drastic measure of quarantining entire cities.[14][16][17]
During the first four weeks, South Korea controlled the potential spread of COVID-19 by using high-tech resources like tracking the use of credit cards and checking CCTV footage of confirmed patients. However, since 18 February, the number of cases increased to more than 1,700 after discovery of the fact that patient No. 31 was a member of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Some media reported that  was difficult for KCDC to screen the patient because Shincheonji teaches that illness is sin. Many members were uncooperative with KCDC and could not be contacted.[18] Shincheonji denied this, and other sources report that the sect did cooperate with the authorities.[19] About half of confirmed cases were linked to the Shincheonji Church as of 27 February; this was verified by health officials.[20] As of 10 March, the KCDC was able to contact and test most of the Shincheonji Church members, with the total number of tests nationally standing at around 200,000.
On 20 January, the first confirmed case was identified as a 35-year-old Chinese woman. The first South Korean national to be infected occurred three days later was a 55-year-old man who worked in Wuhan and returned for a checkup with flu symptoms. The two infection reports were publicly released on 24 January.[1]
On 26 January, a third case as a 54-year-old South Korean man. He had used a rental car and visited three restaurants, a hotel, a convenience store and met his family before admitting himself to hospital. All these places were disinfected.
On 27 January, a fourth case was reported as a 55-year-old South Korean man who returned from Wuhan on 20 January. He first experienced flu symptoms on 21 January and suffered further complications four days later, eventually turning himself in. Both cases were tallied into formal records on 27 January.[21]
On 1 February, an update on the first four patients indicated that the first three patients were showing weaker symptoms and recovering well while the fourth patient was getting treatment from pneumonia. Rumours circulated that the fourth patient had died which health authorities denied.[22]
Two more confirmed cases were reported on 30 January with the fifth patient being a 32-year-old South Korean man who returned from his work at Wuhan on 24 January. The sixth patient was the first case in South Korea who had never visited Wuhan. The 56-year-old man caught the virus when visiting a restaurant with the third patient.[23]
On 31 January, a seventh patient was reported as a 28-year-old South Korean man returning from Wuhan on 23 January. He developed symptoms on 26 January, and was admitted to the hospital on 28 January.[24] On the same day, four more patients were admitted into the record as the eighth patient, 62-year-old South Korean woman, returned from Wuhan. The ninth patient caught the virus from the fifth patient through direct contact while the tenth and the eleventh patient were the wife and child who were infected while visiting the sixth patient.[25]
On 1 February, a 49-year-old Chinese national working in Japan as a tour guide was confirmed as the twelfth patient. He caught the virus while visiting a Japanese patient in Japan and entered South Korea through Gimpo International Airport on 19 January.[22] The KCDC confirmed an additional three cases on 2 February, bringing the total to fifteen.[26]
A woman, who had returned from Thailand after a five-day vacation, was tested positive and confirmed as the sixteenth case on 4 February.[27] Three more cases were confirmed on 5 February, bringing the total case count to 19. The seventeenth and nineteenth patients had attended a conference in Singapore and been in contact with an infected individual there.[28] The very same day the KCDC announced that the second patient had been released from hospital after being tested negative in consecutive tests, becoming the country's first coronavirus patient to fully recover.[29]

On 18 February, South Korea confirmed its 31st case in Daegu, a member of the Shincheonji religious organisation. The patient continued to go to gatherings of Shincheonji days after showing symptoms, which are typically held with people in very close proximity and include physical contact of the members. Many of the patient's close contacts would turn out to be infected, triggering a drastic escalation of the South Korean spread of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.[32][33]
On 19 February, the number of confirmed cases increased by 20. On 20 February,  70[3] new cases were confirmed, giving a total of 104 confirmed cases, according to the KCDC. According to Reuters, KCDC attributed the sudden jump of 70 cases linked to ""Patient No. 31"", who had participated in a gathering in Daegu at the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony.[3]
On 20 February, the streets of Daegu were empty in reaction to the Shincheonji outbreak. A resident described the reaction, stating ""It's like someone dropped a bomb in the middle of the city. It looks like a zombie apocalypse.""[3] The first death was reported[34] in a mental ward of Cheongdo Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo County. According to the mayor of Daegu, the number of suspected cases as of 21 February was 544 among 4,400 examined followers of the church.[35] The hospital was suspected as the source of the present outbreak after it was visited by a woman who became the second fatal case of South Korea on that day. Upon investigation, it was determined that the infection had spread to that hospital through a funeral ceremony attended by members of the church.[36][37]
All South Korean military bases were on lockdown after tests confirmed three soldiers to be positive for the virus.[36] Airlines cut connections and cultural schedules were being canceled due to fears of further spread.[38][39] United States Forces Korea  raised the alert level from low to moderate and  cut off non-essential travel to and from USFK Daegu.[40] USFK Daegu's school facilities were closed and non-essential personnel were ordered to stay at home while any visitors going there were not allowed to enter.[40] USFK announced that the widow of a retired soldier who was in Daegu was diagnosed to be positive for the virus on 24 February.[41] Camp Humphreys enacted virus detection protocols, including temperature checks and raised the alert level to high.[42] On 26 February, an American soldier based at Camp Carroll was diagnosed to be positive and was quarantined away from bases via off-base housing unit[43] with contact tracing done that showed his movements to Camp Walker.[44]
As of 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 reported symptoms.[45] At the time, 169 confirmed cases involved the same church and another 111 came from the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital.[46] 23 February saw another 123 cases with 75 being from Shincheonji[47] and 24 February saw 161 additional cases with 129 being from the same religious group. Over 27,000 people have been tested for the virus with 19,127 negative results.[48]
On 24 February, 15 countries imposed travel restrictions to and from South Korea.[49] It was also reported that a senior health official overseeing the COVID-19 efforts in Daegu tested positive and was also a member of Shincheonji.[50][51] Within a few days, a petition to the nation's president urging for the disbandment of the church had over 750,000 signatures. Their headquarters in Gwacheon was raided by law enforcement and government officials said all 245,000 members of the religious group would be found and tested.[51]
On 28 February, over 2,000 confirmed cases were reported.[52] On 2 March, there were over 4,200 confirmed cases.[53] With an additional 4,000 cases of COVID-19 within two weeks, and roughly 60% of the total infections nationwide having stemmed from the church, the Seoul city government asked prosecutors to press charges against the religious group's founder and senior members for murder, causing harm, and for violating the Infectious Disease and Control Act.[54] Interviews have occurred with all 230,000 members of the religious group and nearly 9,000 were said to be showing symptoms of the virus.[55] Due to the number of infections in the country, ninety-five countries have banned or limited entry for South Korean passport holders.[56] Testing is also conducted at drive-through testing sites where patients do not leave their vehicles, but are met by medical personnel in hazmat suits over several stations. The process is completed in a few minutes and results come in several days.[57]
On 8 March, KCDC in South Korea announced that 79.4% of confirmed COVID-19 cases were related to group infection. KCDC also announced that outbreak associated with Shincheonji Church totaled 4,482 infections, accounting for 62.8% of the total confirmed cases.[58][59]
March 13 was the first time since the outbreak on January 20 in which the number of recoveries, 177, was larger than the number of those who newly tested positive, 110.[60][61][62]  However, with the recent cluster of cases in Seoul, there are new fears that infections may rise sharply.[63]
The controversy about Shincheonji also continued, and generated international interest. After the lawsuit started by the Mayor of Seoul, the police raided the church premises to check whether the list of members supplied by Shincheonji pursuant to a request by the authorities was, as the Mayor argued, not complete. The authorities checked the list seized during the raid with the one Shincheonji had supplied, and concluded that discrepancies were minor.[64]
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) expressed concern that religious freedom rights of Shincheonji members may be violated in South Korea by ""exaggerating the church's role in the outbreak,"" and stated that, ""USCIRF has received reports of individuals encountering discrimination at work and spousal abuse because of their affiliation with the church.""[65] USCIRF reported that South Korean ""Vice Minister of Health Kim Kang-lip has publicly stated that the Shincheonji church has cooperated with authorities.""[65] The Belgian NGO Human Rights Without Frontiers released a ""White Paper"" claiming that, although it did make ""mistakes"" in its management of the crisis, Shincheonji had also been discriminated because of its status as an unpopular group in South Korea.[66]
On 17 March, around 79 church devotees were infected with the virus after attending the River of Grace Community Church. The infections were claimed to have been caused by spraying salt-water into followers' mouths, under the belief that this would protect them from the virus.[67][68]
In its efforts to fight and contain the virus, South Korea has combined testing with contact tracing.
Infected South Koreans are required to go into isolation in government shelters. Their phones and credit card data are used to trace their prior movements and find their contacts. Those who are determined to have been near the infected individual receive phone alerts with information about their prior movements.[160]
According to Chun Byung-Chul, an epidemiologist at Korea University, high-risk patients who have underlying illnesses are prioritized for hospitalization. Patients with moderate symptoms are sent to ""repurposed corporate training facilities and spaces provided by public institutions,"" where they receive observation and medical support. Patients who recover and test negative twice are released. Close contacts and infected individuals with minimal symptoms who can measure their own temperatures and whose family members are free of any chronic disease are required to self-quarantine for 2 weeks. Local monitoring teams calls the quarantined twice a day to make sure that they stay where they are and to ask about symptoms.[161]
Those ordered to self-quarantine are required to download an app that alerts officials if the patient moves outside of the quarantine. Violators are fined up to $2,500.[162]
As of 18 March, South Korea's KOSPI stock index has dropped nearly 30% compared to a month ago. The drop precipitated on 23 February, when the country raised the coronavirus alert to 'highest level'.[167] As of 15 March, the KOSPI closed at 1,771.44 and the Kosdaq finished at 524 points, down 7%, prompting the Financial Supervisory Commission to impose a six-month ban on short-selling, the first such drastic action in nearly nine years. This was despite a markedly lower daily increase in cases. Automaker Hyundai Motor Company, having shut down its factories as the outbreak intensified, saw exports drop 21.4% in February from the same month last year.[168]
As of 25 February, Daegu officials were aggressively warning residents to take precautions, while allowing private businesses such as restaurants to stay open. As a precautionary measure, many restaurants check the temperatures of their customers before accepting them. It is common for ""offices, hotels, and other large buildings"" to use thermal image cameras in order to identify people with fevers.[162] All Daegu's public libraries, museums, churches, day-care centers and courts had been closed.[169][needs update]
Apart from the city of Daegu and the church community involved, most of South Korea is operating close to normality, although nine planned festivals have been closed and tax-free retailers are closing.[170] The South Korean military manpower agency made an announcement that conscription from Daegu will temporarily be suspended.[171] The Daegu Office of Education decided to postpone the start of every school in the region by one week.[172]
Numerous educational institutes have temporarily shut down, including dozens of kindergartens in Daegu and several elementary schools in Seoul.[173] As of 18 February, most universities in South Korea had announced plans to postpone the start of the spring semester.

On 26 January, the Korean Medical Association (KMA) asked the government to temporarily bar entry to all travelers arriving from mainland China, but this recommendation was not followed.[185] On 27 January, KMA President Choi Dae-zip said: ""The third confirmed case indicates that we have reached the point where we have to get rid of passive stance and actively prepare for the worsening of the situation,  (and) the government should thoroughly monitor the trend of China's national outbreak of the virus and prepare administrative measures such as complete entry ban from China in case of the worst situation.""[186] On 3 February, The KMA recommended halting all travel from China, rather than only from Hubei province.[187] After all, The KMA called for stronger government response in a total of six statements between 20 January, when the nation's first confirmed case occurred, and 18 February. A short time after that, cases spiked in Daegu and throughout the country.[188]

In February 2020, an entrance to a South Korean restaurant in downtown Seoul reportedly had a sign in red Chinese characters stating: ""No Chinese Allowed.""[193] ""No Chinese"" signs have been cropping up throughout the country, and some businesses are simply banning all foreigners.[194] Some foreign residents have been excluded from the government mask distribution program as it is currently only allowed to 1.25 million foreigners who were subscribed to the public health insurance.  There is a shortage of face masks in S.Korea.[195] Concerning COVID-19, More than 760,000 South Korean citizens have signed a petition lobbying the government to ban Chinese tourists from entering the country.[196][197] The Daegu Lantern Festival mistakenly posted a notice in English that no foreigners are allowed to visit.  However, the wrong sentence was removed and it was revealed a translation error by the  PR agency regarding statement from a Daegu government official. The official in the Daegu city stated that the original message was the notification to foreign tourists about the delayed schedule of festival over COVID-19 concerns.[198]

Park expressed cautiously his desire  that the coronavirus outbreak is 'passed the peak' as per the result regarding the number of new daily infections has declined in recent days.[204]  The S. Korean government has the ability operate about 15,000 diagnostic test per day and has conducted over 190,000 tests by 10 March nationwide. Park also answered the inquiry from CNN about practicable tips for controlling COVID-19. Park believes that dealing with outbreaks by focusing efforts on early testing and global cooperation would be crucial instead of the lockdown option, as the virus could still spread quickly without testing.[204] S. Korean authorities have arranged the two types of facilities, one for about 10% of coronavirus patients who required hospitalization and another for  the patients who were only suffering from mild symptoms.[204]
Time magazine and BBC News concluded that the reason for the high number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in South Korea is thanks to the relative ""openness"" and ""transparency"" in the Korean society.[205] As for the rapid spread of the virus, the reason was the religious group Shincheonji Church.[206] The Blue House announced on 28 February the current status of coronavirus tests in three countries: Korea, the United States, and Japan, and analyzed statistically the reasons why there were so many confirmed cases in South Korea: the number of inspections was 26 or 120 times higher than other countries. The cumulative number of inspections was about 53,000 in South Korea, with only 2,000 in Japan and 440 cases examined in the United States. After the tests, the rate of confirmed cases was highest in Japan (9.04%), followed by Korea (3.3%) and the United States (3.15%).[183]
ZDF, a major public broadcaster in Germany, assessed that Korea's COVID-19 management, conducting massive inspections daily, is the fastest but hardest way to transparently disclose the confirmed COVID-19 cases.[207] It was now emphasized that it would be necessary to conduct an aggressive test similar to South Korea for COVID-19. Public German broadcaster ARD praised the efficiency of the testing methods developed by South Korea, such as the drive-through COVID-19 screening.[208] Since March 8, Germany has been operating drive-through inspection stations in North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, where the number of infected people is increasing. Drive-through inspection stations were also installed in several places in the UK two weeks ago[when?]. Germany has a medical infrastructure capable of testing 16,000 people per day.[209][210][211][212]
Bloomberg L.P. analyzed the reason for the low death rate in South Korea. South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the outbreak of MERS in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards,  the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of March 3. Officials in Seoul operate ""drive-thru"" testing stations for quick testing.  Diagnostics company Seegene Inc. is also exporting its test kits to other countries including China, Europe and the USA.[213][214]
AFP attributed the factors behind the low death rate of South Korea to the rigorous testing and the infected population profile. South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus and most of its members are young women. Statistics show that the virus is most deadly among older generations and men. So the death rate in South Korea is lower than other countries.[215]
CNN reported the innovative drive-through testing for COVID-19 in the northern city of Goyang, which was inspired by the drive-through counters at Starbucks.[216]
Reuters detailed the new testing facilities in South Korea. Several drive-through coronavirus screening centres were built, including roadside testing facilities. Their purpose is to diagnose patients quickly, while preventing the infection of others in, e.g., a hospital waiting room or a community health center. The entire testing procedure takes several minutes.[217]
William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, stressed the importance of the broad testing efforts in South Korea. It would provide us with an unclouded picture of the COVID-19 illness.[218] Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton has recommended the drive-thru coronavirus testing in Australia.[219] on March 10, Australia opened the first drive-through testing station in Adelaide. 
[220][220]
Business Insider analyzed the difference of coverage of patient testing patients for COVID-19, comparing the USA to South Korea. Per million citizens, South Korea tested 700 times more than the USA.[221] Fortune explained South Korea's efforts of setting up several ""drive-thru"" coronavirus screening facilities as contributing to testing thousands of samples a day.[222]
The Washington Post has praised the South Korean government's handling of coronavirus outbreak and stated that South Korea is a model for the U.S. response instead of Iran.[223] The Washington Post also appreciated South Korea's response as a successful model for democratic countries.[224]
Agence France-Presse has compared South Korea's handling of coronavirus outbreak with China. The newspaper stated that ""While China locked down cities, Seoul embraced widespread testing and public notice of movements of those infected, raising some privacy concerns"". Also, AFP analyzed that the South Korean government handled the crisis using a model of open information, public participation, and widespread testing.[225] Additionally, according to the paper, Masahiro Kami, a chairperson of the Tokyo-based Medical Governance Research Institute stated that South Korea is a good model for every country for handling the coronavirus outbreak.[226]
WSJ analyzed the aggressive Coronavirus Test Program in S.Korea. The government contacted the citizens proactively to test the coronavirus in various ways including a home visit, a quick 10 minutes drop off drive-through COVID-19 testing center free of charge. Although S.Korea not yet defeated the outbreak, experts credit the emphasis on energetic COVID-19 test program with reducing case numbers and fatalities.[227][228]
UPI has analyzed that South Korea's model has worked on handling coronavirus outbreak without any further harder restrictions on foreigners.[229] The paper also observed that Health authorities have aggressively promoted hygiene and social distancing.[230] Additionally, according to the paper Kim Jong-hwan, an administrator at Seoul Metropolitan Eosunpyeong Hospital positively evaluated the government's deal with coronavirus outbreak by stating that ""The government's response has been so well-organized. I'm proud of it.""[231]

Puerto Rico's population is at a heightened risk of COVID-19 due to its higher proportion of elderly people compared to the US as a whole. In 2017, 21% in Puerto Rico versus 16% in the US are over the age of 65. Additionally, elderly residents of Puerto Rico are seven times more likely to live in poverty than in the US. Puerto Rico has one fifth as many intensive care unit beds per capita than in the US. Additionally, Puerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricane Maria and the 2019–2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes.[4][5]
Beginning in late January, Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport became one of twenty US airports where travelers underwent additional screening.

The decision is effective as of 11 March 2020 and is believed to reduce the virus spreading as well as the burden on the health care system.[216]
On 13 March, the government decided to temporarily abolish the demand of a doctor's certificate for 14 days for people staying home from work due to illness (i.e. sick pay period). Previously a doctor's certificate was needed after seven days.[217]

Poland ,"
In February and March 2020, during the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, Polish health authorities carried out laboratory testing of suspected cases of infection by SARS-CoV-2, one of the seven known human coronaviruses, as well as home quarantining and monitoring.[9][10] The first case of a laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Poland was that of a man hospitalised in Zielona Góra, with confirmation announced officially on 4 March 2020.[2][3] The local transmission phase of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland was declared to the World Health Organization on 10 March.[11][12] The first death from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Poland was that of a 56-year-old woman on 12 March.[13]
Warsaw Chopin Airport made special surveys for passengers arriving from China.[14]
As of 29 February 2020[update], four-member teams at the National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene (NIPH–NIH) together with the Berlin hospital Charité had carried out 307 genetic tests of samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 carriers, and 28 tests were waiting to be analysed. NIPH–NIH carried out the tests in its Warsaw laboratory and in the Wojewódzki Szpital Zakaźny in Warsaw. Diagnostic laboratories in eight other towns were being prepared for making similar analyses. The Ministry of Health refused to state how many test kits were available in Polish laboratories.[16]
On 4 March, the Minister of Health claimed that nine laboratories were carrying out SARS-CoV-2 testing (NIPH–NIH and Voivodeship Infectious Disease Hospital in Warsaw, and laboratories in Olsztyn, Wrocław, Poznań, Katowice, Rzeszów, Gdańsk and Kielce),[3] while OKO.press claimed that only four laboratories carried out the testing.[17] The Minister claimed that ""sanitary–epidemiological stations"" in Lublin, Łódź and Poznań would start SARS-CoV-2 tests the following day.[3] On 6 March, the Minister stated that 13 laboratories were running SARS-CoV-2 tests.[18]
A new law (nicknamed Polish: specustawa,[19] lit. special law) to manage a possible epidemic of COVID-19 or other infectious diseases in Poland via administrative, budgetary and epidemiological measures passed through a first reading by a parliamentary committee and through second and third readings by the Polish lower house of parliament, the Sejm, on 1 and 2 March, with 400 votes out of 418 in favour in the third reading.[20] Konfederacja was the only parliamentary club which voted against the measure.[21] Philosopher and law professor Jerzy Zajadło [pl] praised the discussion of the bill in the Sejm, in that the Speaker allowed members of parliament to discuss the bill under the principles of deliberative democracy, which he judged rare for the parliament dominated by PiS. Zajadło criticised the bill as establishing vague powers with little chance of checks and balances, which he saw as being in the spirit of the approach of the political party in power; he saw the bill as establishing a permanent state of emergency for COVID-19 and all other contagious diseases; he criticised the wide array of changes implied in the law as having consequences difficult to predict; and he judged the law to be unnecessary given that laws covering the situation already existed.[19] Ewa Łętowska [pl], a former judge in the Polish Constitutional Tribunal, also criticised the law as effectively creating a new, 180-day long state of emergency, in addition to the state of emergency rules defined in the Polish Constitution for a maximum of 90 days. She interpreted the law as giving the authorities arbitrary power without control by administrative courts.[22]

Citing concerns over the potential of an impending outbreak in the province, Premier Scott Moe announced on March 12 that he would not pursue a snap provincial election. Saskatchewan's next general election is scheduled for October 26, 2020.[14]
On March 13, 2020, following the second presumptive case in the province, the Saskatchewan government announced restrictions on gatherings of more than 250 people in contiguous indoor space, as well as gatherings of more than 50 people if they include participants who had recently travelled internationally.[15][16] Exceptions are permitted for retail shops.[17][18] An exception for faith-based organizations was removed March 16.[17]
As an employer, the government of Saskatchewan has sharply reduced inter-provincial and international travel on government business by any provincial employees. It has also provided that provincial employees who have travelled outside the country, whether on government business or personal travel, must self-isolate for fourteen days upon their return.[18]
On March 17, 2020, the government announced that it was delaying the introduction of the provincial budget, because the government revenue forecasts underlying it were no longer reliable, in light of the current situation.  The Government would announce the planned spending, including for the health care sector, which would see an increase in funding.[19] The same day, the Legislature passed amendments to provincial employment law, to provide unpaid job security to employees during the pandemic.  The amendments passed with the support of both parties.[20] The next day, the Legislature adjourned its spring sitting, with the consent of the Opposition.[21]
Saskatchewan declared a state of emergency on March 18, which included a ban of all gatherings of 50 people or more, restricting capacity of restaurants and similar venues to a maximum of 50 or half (whichever is lower), mandatory closure of all fitness facilities, casinos, and bingo halls, shifting all provincial government entities and crown corporations to remote work on March 23, authorizing the Saskatchewan Health Authority to ""redeploy nurses and other staff and ensure medical supplies and personal protective equipment are available when needed and reduce risk of further exposure to our care providers and patients"", and advising against non-essential travel outside of the province.[22][23][24]
On March 20, Premier Moe signed an order allowing regulations issued pursuant to the state of emergency by the government or chief medical officer, enforceable under provincial law. Law enforcement agencies, including the RCMP, were granted the authority to enforce these measures under penalties of fines or arrest.[25]
The government subsequently announced that residents returning from any international travel would be required by law to self-isolate for 14 days, with those breaking quarantine subject to a $2,000 fine.[26] Notice of this requirement was issued via Alert Ready.[26] Essential travellers such as working crews, transport workers and health care workers are exempt.[26] Premier Moe cited concerns over those not following its previous recommendations for self-isolation as justification.[27]
Additional restrictions were also announced: since March 23, all restaurants, bars, and nightclubs have been restricted to take-out service only (bars and nightclubs may only do so if customers are capable of maintaining a distance of 2 metres from each other). All art galleries, museums, and other recreational, entertainment, and personal service facilities have been ordered closed, and certain types of medical clinics (chiropractors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and registered massage therapists) are restricted to non-elective appointments only. All gatherings of 25 people or more are prohibited unless all patrons are capable of maintaining a distance of 2 metres from each other.[26][28][27]
On March 18, a Sangster's health store in Lawson Heights, Saskatoon was closed after multiple visits by a customer who stated that she had recently returned from international travel to Hawaii, and that multiple passengers on the flight had felt ill. The store's local owner criticized the customer for breaking recommended self-quarantine, even though she had displayed no symptoms herself.[29]
On March 20, Regina Transit and Saskatoon Transit suspended fares for all bus service, but with reduced service.[30][31][32]
The municipal governments of Gravelbourg and Regina declared their own states of emergency with stricter restrictions than those enforced by the province. Regina announced an intent to ban all public meetings larger than 5 people or more (outside of home, workplaces, or as part of essential services), and order the closure of retail stores in specific categories to in-person shopping (including clothing, furniture, games, sporting goods, and toys) effective March 23.[33]  Gravelbourg similarly ordered that all businesses be closed to the public for 14 days (delivery and curbside pickup would still be allowed), and that only a maximum of five employees could be in a building at any one time (with planned special operating requirements for the local Co-op store).[34]
On March 22, the province stated that it would take steps to ensure that its emergency measures maintain precedence over municipal orders that include ""contrary standards"".[35] Minister of Government Relations Lori Carr explained that ""during this time of great uncertainty, it is of the utmost importance that we provide certainty to Saskatchewan residents and make every effort to minimize confusion"", and cited Regina's attempts to close retail stores as an example of a restriction where provincial decisions take precedence.[36][37]
The University of Regina and University of Saskatchewan voluntarily suspended in-person classes on March 16, and will switch to online courses for the remainder of the semester.[38][39] On March 16, the province announced that all public schools would ""wind down"" over the week, and close indefinitely on March 20. No academic penalties were issued for students that do not attend school during the week of March 20, final grades will be issued based on existing progress, and eligible Grade 12 students will be able to graduate.[40][41]
